<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> no Western Power has ever played
a greater part in the problems of the Ottoman
Empire than Great Britain, yet in no other
country in Western Europe is Turkey more
grossly misunderstood. I have been many
times asked by my English acquaintances to
write a book on Turkey from a Turkish point
of view, and two ways of writing were suggested
to me: the one was to compile a detailed work,
the other to write a small and light book. To
take the former advice was not possible to
me, as I found myself incapable of producing a
great and technical work. Besides, I thought
that after all a small and lightly written volume
would have a larger circle of readers, and by its
help I could to some extent correct some of
the mistaken ideas prevailing in England about
Turkey. Therefore I began to write this little
volume in the form of a book of travel, and I
now bring it out under the title of <i>The Diary
of a Turk</i>. By this means I have been able to
talk a little on many matters connected with
Turkey. Let the critic find other points in this
book on which to express his opinion, but do
not let him charge me with ignorance of the
fact that the somewhat unexciting experiences
of an unknown man may be only of slight
interest to the public.</p>

<p>In the chapter on women's affairs I have
quoted a few paragraphs from two articles which
I contributed some time ago to two London
weeklies, the <i>Queen</i> and the <i>Lady</i>, I render
my thanks to the Editors of these papers for
kindly permitting me to reproduce them here.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br /><br />

<small>MY HOME IN ASIA MINOR.</small><br /><br /></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>My Asiatic origin&mdash;My great-grandfather's religious order&mdash;
His miracles&mdash;My grandfather and Sultan Mahmud II.
&mdash;An ordeal by wine&mdash;My father's charitable extravagance&mdash;His
death&mdash;Primitive surgery in Asia Minor&mdash;
The original home of vaccination&mdash;My mother's European
ancestors&mdash;Writing a forbidden accomplishment
for women.</p></blockquote>

<p>I was born in the ancient town of Angora, Asia
Minor, famous not alone for its silky-haired cats
and goats, but also for its historical and archæological
importance, and with it my memories of
early days, and therefore the pages of my
desultory journal, naturally begin. Men of
learning who have engaged in researches into
the archæology and biblical history of Asia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
Minor have come to the conclusion that this
town was once in the remote past the principal
centre of a wandering branch of the Celtic
peoples who ultimately settled in Asia Minor.
Although, of course, it was conquered and held
during later generations by the Eastern invaders,
it is even nowadays noticeable that
there is a difference, both of character and
physique, between most of the inhabitants of
our province and those of other provinces, more
especially of Southern and Eastern Asia Minor.
By remarking on this I do not wish to seem
to be trying to trace my origin to a European
race, though I am aware that many people in
this country are unsympathetic, and even,
perhaps, prejudiced, where Orientals are concerned.
My paternal ancestors came across
from Central Asia, and first settled in Khorassan,
in Persia. But as they were devout
followers of the orthodox creed of the Arabian
Prophet they were subjected to the intolerant
oppression of the Persian Moslems, between
whom and the orthodox believers the history of
Western Asia records many a sanguinary feud,
the result of their doctrinal antagonism. My
ancestors were compelled eventually to emigrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
to Asia Minor over a hundred and fifty years
ago, and there they found a more hospitable
reception. My great-grandfather was the
sheikh or head of a religious order called
<i>Halvati</i>, or, to give the name an English
equivalent, "those who worship in seclusion."
The name arises from one of the strict rules
of the order, that its rites must not be displayed
to the outside public, doubtless a measure for
the prevention of hypocrisy. Historical research
has traced the foundation of the order to Ali,
the son-in-law of Mohammed. Shortly after
settling in Asia Minor the disciples of the great
sheikh increased to a number approaching
eighty thousand, and pilgrims came to his
monastic dwelling from all the neighbouring
provinces. It was not only in Anatolia and
Syria that his name was honoured; he is mentioned
with reverence in the books written in
Egypt at that time. It must not be imagined
that he was a kind of <i>Mahdi</i>, a name which is
familiar in England on account of its having
been assumed by the late pretender in the
Soudan. In the days gone by many such
Mahdis, or "redeemers," appeared in Western
Asia and the Northern half of Africa, disguis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>ing
under this apostolic name their ambition of
attaining temporal power and worldly glory.</p>

<p>In spite of his having so great a number of
disciples, my great-grandfather lived, together
with his immediate devotees, in complete retirement.
The Ottoman Sovereign of the time
heard of him and sent a messenger informing
him that he wished to grant certain pious endowments
to his monastic institution in the little
town of Tcherkesh, which is situated half-way
between Angora and the Black Sea coast. My
great-grandfather declined to receive such unnecessary
worldly assistance, and, according to
one of the traditions concerning his miraculous
doings which used to be related in our family
circle, he struck his staff against the wall in the
presence of the envoy of the sovereign, and
thereupon a stream of precious metal began
to flow down. He said to the envoy (who
became a devoted disciple later on) that he
needed not such worldly things. There is
another anecdote of him which was told in my
younger days. There was in our house a
large deerskin upon which my father used to
prostrate himself during his prayers. I often
heard it said that this was the skin of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
deer upon which my great-grandfather, the holy
hermit, was accustomed to ride every Friday,
the Sabbath day of our people, from his home
in Asia Minor to Mecca, in Arabia, to attend
the Friday service in the sacred sepulchre of the
Prophet (on whose shrine be blessing!). Of
course, I quite believed these legends in my
childhood. I can make no comment on them
now. "The responsibility of vouching for the
fact lies with the narrator," is an Arab saying
often quoted by our Oriental historians in
relating extraordinary events. I must follow
their example. It has, however, always been a
great grief to me that along with the deerskin
we did not inherit that useful staff.</p>

<p>My grandfather, whose views in his early
days on the religious orders did not coincide
with those of his father, did not become a
disciple of the great hermit-sheikh, so the latter
had to point out to him that the rules of the
order forbade his remaining any longer in the
monastic institution. He left the place accordingly,
and joined a small caravan which was
starting off to the town of Angora, where he
eventually settled. It was a distance of four
days' journey on camel-back. This town was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
the centre of learning at that time, and there
is there a well-known shrine of a saint, whose
name is Haji Beiram. Many thousands of
pilgrims visit his mausoleum every year. My
grandfather did not know anyone in the town,
and had no means of supporting himself. He
went to the shrine, and after making a prayer at
the graveside of the saint, he became absorbed
in contemplation and eventually slumbered. In
his dream he saw the saint, who asked him his
name, and also whether he could read. The
answer to the second question was unsatisfactory,
and thereupon the saint gave him a lesson.
On waking up my grandfather went out and
saw several students entering the adjacent
<i>madrasseh</i> or theological school. He followed
them, and in the <i>madrasseh</i> he entered into
conversation with one of the newly-made
lecturers. In these old-fashioned centres of
learning the reputation of a lecturer depends in
great measure on the number of students who
attend his lectures. The lecturer took my
grandfather, who was then little more than a
boy, into his class, and settled him in a room
along with his few other pupils. He studied
in this <i>madrasseh</i> very many years, and ulti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>mately
became himself a professor of theology,
philosophy, and the temporal law of the
Moslems. He made his fame largely by
delivering addresses in different mosques on
the commentaries of the Koran, which attracted
large audiences. Many learned men, engaged
in kindred studies throughout Asiatic Turkey,
used to apply to him for the solution of difficult
points. The representative of the sovereign in
this town used to pay him visits of respect, but
he himself never in his life crossed the threshold
of a government office.</p>

<p>During the reign of Sultan Mahmud II., who
ruled from 1808 till 1839, there took place an
imperial wedding at Constantinople to which
persons of distinction in all classes of society
throughout the country were invited. The
chief physician of the Sultan (whose grandson
is at present attached as councillor to the
Ottoman Embassy in London), who had been
a pupil of my grandfather's, noticed that his
name was not on the list, and strongly recommended
his sovereign to invite him. A
courier set out for Asia Minor at once, and
brought my grandfather to the capital. A
great banquet was given in the palace in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
honour of the event to all the religious dignitaries
and principal <i>Ulema</i>, that is to say, the
learned hierarchy of the realm. Mahmud II.
devised a curious plan for testing the fortitude
and strength of character of these pious
people. During the banquet servants brought
in bottles filled with a red-coloured liquid.
Several guards with drawn swords in their
hands followed the attendants, and stood in
the entrance. The bewildered guests naturally
did not know what to make of it, and
awaited events in anxious silence. Then, to
their consternation, it was solemnly announced
that the liquid in the bottles was wine. Wine!
an abominable intoxicant, of which it is strictly
forbidden to the faithful to touch even a single
drop! The pernicious fluid, which has received
from the Prophet himself the name of the
"mother of evils"! (I must explain, by the
way, that Mahmud wished to remodel his
empire. After getting rid of those formidable
opponents, the Janissaries, he adopted not only
some of the European methods of administration,
but also some of the Western customs
and modes of life, and among other things he
ordered his officials and army to wear costumes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
and uniforms made after the European style.
This policy had already occasioned disquietude
and suspicion in the pious heads under turbans
in Asia.) When the wine was brought before
that religiously sober assembly, an announcement
was made that "as the Sultan ruled on
European soil he wished to bring his country
more into harmony with the Franks (all the
people of Western Europe are so called), and any
unwillingness on the part of his subjects would
possibly hasten the decay of his empire. It
was, moreover, the desire of the sovereign that
narrow-minded superstition and the dislike of
new things, even though they were borrowed
from the Franks, should disappear." The
announcement was concluded by the warning
that those guests who should refuse to drink
wine would be regarded as rebellious against
the will of their sovereign. Face to face with
this somewhat startling alternative, the guests
became pale of countenance and mute of tongue,
for, be it remembered, he who gave this order
was a real autocrat, who had even exterminated
the awe-inspiring Janissaries. However, my
grandfather sprang up from his seat and said,
"could not our sovereign find any other virtues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
among the Franks worth imitating?" He
pointed out, moreover, that the law against
drinking wine, the ordinance of the faith, was
given to them by an authority superior even to
that of his Majesty. He then started to go out,
and while he was forcing his way through the
servants and guards, Sultan Mahmud, who was
watching this comedy literally from behind the
scenes, suddenly stepped in smiling, and, in
order to dispel the fear of the white-bearded,
green-turbaned gentlemen, he said he simply
meant to test the fortitude and character of the
people who were to guide his subjects in the
paths of religion and rectitude.</p>

<p>The Sultan later granted an audience to my
grandfather, and asked him to give lessons in
the Arabic language to the imperial princes
(among whom was Abdul Mejid, who was
Sultan during the Crimean campaign), and
urged him to settle in Constantinople, promising
that he would eventually make him Sheikh-ul-Islam,
that is, the head of the religious
magistrates and learned hierarchy. But my
grandfather prayed the sovereign to pardon
him for not accepting this honour, saying that
it was his earnest desire to pass his remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
days of life in retirement and study. He only
requested one boon&mdash;that he might be granted
the vacant headship of the madrasseh or college
in which he had studied for so many years, and
with this, the enjoyment of the lands devised to
it by the Crown.</p>

<p>When my grandfather had returned to his
own town, Sultan Mahmud, who understood
and appreciated his quiet contentment, wrote
out with his own hand a saying of the Prophet,
had it illuminated, and sent it to him as a
present Roughly translated it runs as follows:&mdash;"The
Lord loveth the man of learning who
is pious, contented, modest and retiring."
Subsequently, too, he granted my grandfather's
request, and, as an additional clause to the endowment,
he made a provision that these lands
should be inherited as real estate by his posterity,
provided that they should, after attaining the
age of twenty years, qualify themselves by an
examination before the proper authorities on
those subjects in which he was himself so well
versed. The royal firmans, with the imperial
signature on them, beautifully written on the
finest vellum, are still in the possession of our
family. These lands came down to me and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
my brothers, but, in spite of all provisions to the
contrary, they were confiscated during the reign
of the present Sultan, a reign which has been
so conspicuous for the suppression of the civil
rights and the oppression of the person of the
individual.</p>

<p>We sued the Government to get our property
back, and spent all our money in different courts
over lawsuits which lasted fifteen years, but we
could not have expected to succeed, for, as a
Turkish poet has written,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">
When the judge is the defendant and the witnesses are
bought,</div>
<div class="line">How can you look for justice from the interested court?</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>When my grandfather died at the age of
eighty-two my own father inherited the endowed
estate; he was not so learned and able as his
father. His only brother, having entered into
the Government service, forfeited his share.
My father suffered from an excess of charity,
and in helping others he expended the greater
portion of the revenue of his own estate as well
as a part of my mother's private income. His
charitable extravagance became at length so
inordinate that he could not even dine without
inviting every day many guests, no matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
whether their position was humble or the
reverse. When he died, killed by the
murderous attack of a drunken Government
official, he left us practically nothing but the
endowed lands, which he could not have sold,
and these lands, as I pointed out before, were
taken over by the Government of the present
Sultan. We were relieved from want by the
fact that the bulk of my mother's property
remained intact Fortunately my father had
not been able to squander it.</p>

<p>I was nine years old when the drunken
official attacked him, and so caused his death,
which happened thus:&mdash;One evening a few
women visitors came to call on my mother.
As it is our custom in the East to keep our
women strictly secluded, my father had to
retire before these veiled visitors entered. He
asked me to come out with him to spend the
evening with some neighbouring friends, and
there we saw the intoxicated man. My father
had a very great abhorrence of drunkenness and
drunkards, and he could not bear to be in the
same room with the man, who was violently drunk
and shouting and singing. A quarrel arose between
them. The man attacked my father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
and caught him by his long white beard. My
father pushed the assailant back, and in doing so
accidentally put his thumb into the drunkard's
mouth, with the result that he was badly bitten.
Although Asia Minor was the cradle of some
of the ancient civilisations, it has not profited
from the facilities afforded to mankind by
modern discoveries. There was no surgeon
in our town properly qualified by scientific
training, and so my father's thumb lacked
proper treatment.</p>

<p>The only medical men were, as a rule, barbers,
who added to their proper profession that of
letting blood for their customers when it was
considered necessary. Bleeding of course used
to be in favour in Europe generally, and it is
still largely practised in the East. There are
a great many people in my native country who
think that a periodical loss of blood purifies the
system, and have themselves bled accordingly.
The early part of the summer is a favourite
time for the operation, before the season for eating
fresh fruit arrives. Blood is let either by a
lancet, or else by means of leeches which are
applied to the arms and legs. The men who
were charged with my father's treatment were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
an old barber and a professional blood-letter.
They used all their choicest ointments, making
my father's thumb worse every day. They
used to criticise each other's skill in surgery.
The professional blood-letter told us that he
was once an army surgeon, and it was his
boast that during the Crimean War he had cut
off the arms and legs of dozens of wounded
soldiers. He doubtless facilitated the departure
of these unfortunates to the place whither he
ultimately sent my father. In spite of his
experiences, however, he did not amputate my
parent's arm, which might have prevented the
gangrene which proved fatal. My mother's
efforts to obtain the condemnation of the
drunken official, as the murderer of her husband,
failed. He was only sentenced to a few
months of imprisonment, and to pay us an indemnity
of about five hundred pounds.</p>

<p>Perhaps I shall be pardoned for a slight
digression here. I laid some emphasis on the
backward condition of the art of surgery in my
native town, but I do not mean thereby that
Turkey has been altogether behindhand in
the art of medicine. In some particulars she
has even led the way. For instance, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
may claim the discovery of inoculation as a
defence against smallpox, and it is worth
while recalling the fact that Lady Mary Wortley
Montagu introduced the treatment into England
from Turkey many years before Jenner
made his first experiment. As Lady Mary
saw it, inoculation was performed with lymph
taken from human beings, but according to
the <i>Tarikhi Jevdet</i> (vol. ii., p. 341, press
mark Turk. 9, British Museum Library),
inoculation was also performed in a manner
suggestive of calf-lymph. A Turkoman of
the pastoral tribes in Asia Minor was paying
a visit to Constantinople, and he saw
the children being inoculated with other children's
lymph. He said that in his own country
the lymph was taken from the fingers of those
who milked the cows. The book, moreover,
states that Lady Mary heard of the Turkoman's
statement, though she does not mention
this in her letter.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>
<p>The Circassians and some of the tribes of
Caucasus are said to have been acquainted with
the uses of inoculation in olden days. They
were chiefly slave-dealers, and they had to take
great care of their young girl-captives, more
especially as regarded any sort of disfigurement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>which would destroy their good looks, and consequently
their value. Of the early history
of the sickness little is known, but it is a
well-established fact that the symptoms were
first clearly diagnosed by the ancient Arab
physician, Rhazes, whose name is well
known to Orientalists and students of medical
history. His book is entitled <i>Kitab-ul-Jederee
Vel-Hassabeh</i>, the translation of which is
<i>Treatise of Smallpox and Measles</i>. This work
was translated into English from a Latin
version by T. Stark early in the eighteenth
century.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">****</span></p>

<p>The business-like European manner of investing
money is not known among our people.
Those who do not know what to do with their
spare money, and who fear it may be stolen, or
kindly taken charge of by the officials of the
paternal Sultan, hide their cash by burying it in
corners of their houses or fields. But we did
not hide the five hundred pounds belonging to
my mother. Someone suggested to us that we
should buy mohair goats, of which the hair, cut
every spring, would yield us an annual income.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
This was a little after the Russo-Turkish War,
and in the consequent depression of trade even
the silky-haired, valuable Angora goat was to be
cheaply bought We purchased three hundred
of these animals. But misfortunes never come
alone. In a year's time a disease broke out
among the greater part of the animals in our
province, and almost all our goats died. My
mother, in her simple faith, attributed this to
kismet, and consoled herself and us accordingly.</p>

<p>My mother is a woman of tact and great
natural intelligence, but owing to the backward
condition of women in the East, due to their
surroundings, her intelligence has not had the
benefit of culture. She is, of course, a fatalist,
and she believes all she is told by her religious
teachers, who are not very learned themselves.
She is not ignorant; on the contrary, she was in
her time the most well-read woman of our town.
Indeed, so far was she in advance of the other
ladies, that they used to visit her for the
purpose of hearing her read aloud from the
books of sacred legends and hymns which are
their principal literature. She cannot write at
all. This perhaps requires some explanation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Formerly girls in Turkey were not allowed to
learn the mystery of caligraphy. We have had
some excellent poetesses in days gone by, but
none of them could write&mdash;they dictated their
inspirations. The common explanation given
of this traditional prohibition&mdash;for it is a
custom rather than a rule&mdash;was that if girls
once learned writing they might have indulged
in talismanic pastimes, and eventually have
become witches. As a matter of fact, the real
reason was quite different There was a fear,
perhaps not ill-founded, that having once
learned to write they might hasten to make
use of the accomplishment by composing love-letters
to young men with whom they could
not otherwise communicate, for the strict seclusion
of females cuts off all intercourse between
young people of opposite sexes almost as soon
as they have ceased to be infants. This
absurd, in fact harmful, prohibition has of late,
and for some time past, been losing its force.
But it was still strictly observed in my mother's
younger days, and so she was not allowed to
learn to write. In spite, however, of her
incomplete education, she kept us happy, and
by her inborn tact preserved the appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
of our social standing. All members of my
mother's family have a practical business-like
instinct, a quality which is so conspicuously
lacking in those Turks who have no strain of
foreign blood. I am convinced that there is
some European blood in the veins of my
mother's ancestors. She belongs to a family
of soldiers who for generations were charged
by the Ottoman Sultans with the defence of
the provinces and the frontiers of Bosnia and
Herzegovina In those days the Turks used
to make slaves of their captives in war, just as
their enemies used to carry Turks into permanent
captivity when invading their territory.
The antecedents of the people so enslaved can
be traced even now in Hungary and Austria
by their Turkish names. But the captives of
the Turks, as a rule, had to adopt Turkish
names, and so the presence of European blood
can only be determined in Turkey by the
personal appearance and characteristics of the
descendants of the captives. My mother's
soldier-ancestors doubtless intermarried with
European captives. I before disclaimed all
pretensions or desire to pass myself off as a
descendant of a European race when I was de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>scribing
the Asiatic origin of my forefathers.
I am not, nevertheless, contradicting myself
here; for when the pedigree of a person is
being considered with us, it is only his ancestry
on the father's side that counts.</p>

<p>My mother passes a most retired life in her
town and summer houses. In town there is a
market-place situated a few minutes' distance
from our house, which she has never seen in
her whole life. She went, however, to Mecca
on a pilgrimage some five years ago.</p>

<p>"Paradise is beneath the ground over which
mothers walk," said Prophet Mohammed.
This saying is to be thus construed: "If any
man desires to gain paradise, let him obey and
respect his mother." This precept I was
taught to follow from my earliest childhood.
But I fear I must be destined for some place
other than paradise, for when I was a boy I
frequently gave my mother much trouble and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
caused her great and many anxieties, for I
found my conduct free from masculine control
after my father's death, and made good, or bad,
use of my opportunities. I was a child of unthinking
and reckless nature. I had an intense
horror of going to any school. At our summer
residence I owned a flock of geese, and I loved
to spend my time looking after them. I was
therefore given the nickname of 'goose-herd,'
which is tantamount in Turkish to 'idiot'. In
our town-house I trained and reared pigeons,
and I must say I had some excuse for this, as
I have never seen such beautiful birds elsewhere.
They were very small, and of a pure
white hue. They would fly to an extraordinary
altitude, and would remain out of sight for
several hours. At other times they would
suddenly let themselves fall, swooping and
wheeling in mid-air, and then shoot upwards
once more. Birds of this most intelligent and
trainable breed have been frequently taken to
Constantinople, but they cannot live in the
climate of that town.</p>

<p>While I was wasting my time with dumb
companions, my eldest brother and cousins
were quite able to read and write, things which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
to my mind were absolutely past comprehension
and belief. Unable to compel me to attend
any school, my mother at last applied to an old
negro servant of my grandfather's, who was
then living close to us with his white wife and
tawny children. When a boy he had been
bought by my grandfather from the slave-dealers,
and as the emancipation of slaves is
considered the most pious act a Mohammedan
can perform, my grandfather freed him soon
after buying him, gave him some property, and
arranged a marriage for him. This old man
did not approve of my undutiful conduct towards
my mother. In accordance with a promise
which he willingly made to her, one morning
he came to our house and gravely asked me to
go with him to school. I excused myself on
the plea that the books and papers previously
procured for me had been eaten by rats. He
said he would buy new ones for me in the
school, and I told him it was no use buying
them, because I did not understand them.
Then the big black man, showing his white
teeth angrily, moved towards me, and caught
me by the ear with his rough, hard hand, and
practically dragged me as far as the school,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
amidst the malicious chuckling of my brother
and cousins. During lesson-times my thoughts
flew after my geese and pigeons. Many a
time was I led to school most unwillingly in
the same fashion, and it took several months
for the master to persuade me, by much
corporal chastisement, to take the slightest
interest in my lessons.</p>

<p>After a year or so I had to go to a higher
school, where there were hundreds of boys,
several teachers, and a headmaster of ruthless
disposition. In those days flogging was the
principal punishment for all offences of schoolboys.
I have never seen or heard of any
master who carried out his duty of not sparing
the rod more conscientiously, more unbendingly,
and with more self-satisfaction than that headmaster.
Personally, however, I came off more
easily than most, as during the two years of
my attendance in the school I was only beaten
three times. The beating took the usual form
of bastinado, and in my three experiences I
received fifty strokes on the soles of my feet,
twenty of them for my ill-behaviour, fifteen for
my stupidity, and fifteen for my incapacity to
learn arithmetic. I had on several occasions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
played mischievous schoolboy tricks, which
would have brought upon me many a flogging
had I not been careful enough to hoodwink the
watchful eyes of the headmaster and his attendants.
But on the occasion when I received
my twenty strokes, I was detected while rather
irreverently playing pranks during prayer-time.
It was the custom for the headmaster to take
all the boys every afternoon to a special hall
for prayer, and to conduct the service personally.
In our places of worship people prostrate themselves
by laying their foreheads on the floor,
while they repeat again and again the name of
Allah; everyone should then disengage his
thoughts from all earthly things and fix them
"on heaven." The whole service does not
last more than fifteen minutes, and one prostration
only lasts about a minute. One day, when
the whole congregation were prostrate, I quickly
got up and collected the fezzes of the boys who
were near me, piled them in a heap, and at
once re-prostrated myself. When the service
was over, it was observed that several boys
were bareheaded. The master was informed
of the crime that had been committed, for a
Mussulman always prays with covered head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
and a searching inquiry began. One of the
boys, who was a friend of mine, while going
before the master to be interrogated, could not
refrain from laughing at the remembrance of the
fun. The master at once ordered his attendants
to pull the boy down to be beaten.
Seeing that my friend was crying, I went to
the master and swore that the boy was innocent
"How do you know?" he asked me. "Because
he was next to me during the service; I should
have observed him," said I. Then several
boys got up and told the master that the boy
was not at my side during the service, thus
contradicting me unanimously. Whereupon
two attendants were ordered to pull me down
and hold my legs tightly. The master then
gave me twenty fierce blows on my feet, which
made me lame for several days. This was the
last flogging I had in the school.</p>

<p>It may perhaps be of interest if I give some
description of our methods of corporal punishment
in schools, which are still, even the
primitive ones, employed by some masters in
the provinces. In our old schools there were
two kinds of flogging&mdash;one for the girls and
the other for the boys. Girls used to be beaten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>on the palms of their hands. There used to be
an instrument in each school which was called
the <i>flaka</i>. This was a long thick stick, to
which was fastened a loop. The girl's wrists
were fastened to the stick by means of twisting
the loop round it, and the stick was held up by
a person at either end. Then the master (there
were no schoolmistresses), standing in front,
used to inflict the punishment with a thin hard
rod. The number of the strokes usually varied
between five and ten. Laziness, much talking,
and mischievous behaviour were the principal
offences which brought about this punishment
As I remarked before, boys used to be beaten
on their feet&mdash;sometimes on the soles of their
boots, in graver cases without them, and even
sometimes without their socks. The boys had
to be pulled down, and two persons held up
their feet, and the master used to strike the feet
with a thick rod. The number of blows only
exceeded twenty in the case of a very bad
offence, and flogging on the bare feet was
generally the result of the master finding something
inside the culprit's boots or socks to
mitigate the force of the blows. It often
happened that the boys, foreseeing their fate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
used to place between their feet and socks
such things as cotton handkerchiefs, and pieces
of sheepskin. I remember I did not cry
when I was beaten for the first time, as I
thought it was very cowardly to cry in the
presence of so many boys. But a boy who was
sitting next to me said, "You silly! why did
you not cry?" He then told me that each time
he knew he was likely to be punished he placed
some soft stuff inside his socks at once, and
while he was being beaten cried out for mercy
as loudly as possible. He said he made the
master reduce the number of strokes by this plan.</p>

<p>In the old preparatory mixed schools there
used to be another method of keeping children
in order, which, I must admit, was decidedly
barbarous. Those elementary schools for
children consisted only of a large hall with
two galleries in it. The smaller gallery was
occupied by the master, and there he summoned
the children in groups of two or three at a time
to come and say their lessons. There was no
division into classes. The larger gallery was
used for the girls, the boys occupying the
middle of the hall. Although the little scholars
used to have low benches before them, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
had to sit on the floor, each boy or girl having
his or her own mattress or sheepskin, which
the parents had to provide, to sit upon. Now
the master used to have hanging on the wall by
his side a long stick whose length was always
in proportion to the size of the hall-that is to
say, it reached from one end of the room to the
other. Whenever the master observed any of
his pupils not behaving well and not doing
their work, he often did not take the trouble to
call the delinquent up before him, but simply
took down the long heavy rod, held it up by its
thick end, and, with the thin end, struck at any
part of his victim he could reach&mdash;head,
shoulders, or back. Sometimes, if this did not
do, he would poke them in the ribs instead.
This punishment was very common in all the
elementary schools in my time, and was not
peculiar to our province, but practised throughout
the country. I cannot remember whether
I suffered under the long pole in my childhood,
but I imagine I did not, as the masters of these
schools used to spare the children of well-to-do
people for fear of annoying their parents, and
thus forfeiting the chance of getting a better fee.</p>

<p>The bastinado is regarded in England as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
practice of peculiar barbarity, but in Turkey the
belief in its good effects still largely prevails.
"The rod is a gift from heaven" is a common
saying in our language. This means that
flogging inspires a desire in refractory people
to do right I do not propose to enter into
any argument on the merits or demerits of
this subject. I consider personally that a beating
which is well-deserved and reasonably inflicted
often effects a marvellous improvement
in a lawless character, awakes the sluggish
conscience of ruffians, and tames unmanageable
boys. It is doubtful, however, if it is very
effective in inducing children at school to learn
their lessons.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">****</span></p>

<p>About the beginning of a summer season it
was considered that I had been at the school
in my native town long enough. I was then
fourteen years old. My mother was looking
forward to the arrival of the time when she
could send me to Constantinople to complete
my term of study. I left the school when summer
had begun, and we went to our country-house
to spend the summer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>Angora, our native place, has a well-deserved
reputation throughout Asia Minor for its varied
and extensive fruit-gardens. Almost all the
families residing there have their own gardens
a few miles outside the town, and most of them
have their summer residence in the midst of their
gardens. Three streams, flowing from different
directions, join just below the town, and the
valleys of these streams are covered with either
fruit-trees or vineyards. Towards the beginning
of May people begin to transport their
provisions, furniture, and other household
necessities in ox-waggons from the town-houses
to the garden-cottages. They reside in the
country five or six months, according to when
the final harvesting of the autumn fruits takes
place. The women and children stay in the
country, and most of the men go to the town
for their business every day before the heat of
the sun becomes too great, and come back in
the cool of the evening about sunset. In the
middle of the day no one but hardy villagers
can travel, for the heat of our climate is as
excessive in summer as the cold is severe in
winter. The journeys are made on horses,
mules, and donkeys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>

<p>Like most children I used to feel an intense
pleasure in getting away from the town at the
beginning of the summer season, but this was
not so much on account of my dislike of the
town life as of my joy in getting rid of the
horrors of pens and paper, and of the worrying
schoolmaster. In addition to all the usual
country pastimes, such as riding, swimming in
the river, shooting, and fishing (which consists
principally with us of what is known in England
as 'tickling' fish, by putting the hands into
the holes under willows which serve as lairs for
fish, and grasping and throwing the prey on to
the bank), I had a reprehensible way of amusing
myself which is also not unknown to English
boys. This was boldly trespassing into our
neighbours' gardens to get fruit, an amusement
which shocked my poor mother's feelings fearfully.
I used to plunder more for the sake of
the adventure than of eating the plundered
fruit, as our own garden was the best, and our
fruit was the envy of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>During that summer I spent months on our
country estate immune from the punishment I
deserved, but at last I committed a crime which
could not be overlooked by my people. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
helped a lovesick swain, who had been refused,
to carry off his lady-love <i>vi et armis</i>. Before I
begin to relate the incident I should like to
remark that the habit of marriage by abduction
was not originally Turkish. It was introduced
into Asia Minor by the Caucasian emigrants,
and used to be occasionally practised by people
of Circassian origin. Almost all Circassian
marriages take place through kidnapping. It
is the custom for a Circassian to carry off his
bride, whether the families of both parties find
the match suitable or not. It is expected that
he shall prove his bravery by taking this step, and
if he is considered by the girl's people to be a
fitting suitor, things may afterwards be arranged
in a friendly manner; if not, it becomes a question
of honour, which ends in feud, and often
in bloodshed. With our people this practice is
viewed almost with horror, and my complicity
in the affair I have referred to was considered
by everyone a very grave misdemeanour.</p>

<p>In the kidnapping expedition in which I was
implicated the members of the girl's family
could not venture to fight to regain her, as the
lover's family was stronger in male relations and
friends, while on the other hand, to appeal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
the law would cause them endless worries and
expense. The abducted bride's people were
by no means socially superior to those of the
bridegroom, but they had refused the regular
demand for marriage. The girl was born of a
Circassian mother, and I believe she must have
inherited the instinct of her race. She wished
to marry her lover, so she managed to send word
to him that she would appear in the garden
adjacent to her house at an hour previously
fixed. The expedition was composed of three
men&mdash;myself, the lover, and a powerfully built
man of Circassian descent, who had the best
horse under him and who had to carry the girl.
We started from our neighbourhood at dark, and
after an hour and a half's ride on the main road
we took a side-way on approaching the country
residence of the girl's people. We tied up our
horses to trees, and while creeping through the
thickly planted fruit-gardens as quietly as possible,
we saw someone moving, wrapped in a
long white cloak. It was the girl, and she
was shivering, even on that warm summer
evening, when we approached her, and our big
companion took her on his shoulders. The
lover looked, it seemed to me, at this moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
hopelessly stupid, possibly by reason of his
mingled feelings of joy and anxiety. We went
back to the place where our horses were. The
captured bride was mounted on the big
Circassian's horse, holding tightly to the man's
shoulders. We started, and on regaining
the main road we had to ride with moderate
speed, as the girl could not stand the strain of
violent galloping. The bridegroom and I were
constantly looking behind, anticipating pursuit
and a possible attempt at recapture. I was
armed with a flint pistol and a club, formidably
decorated with a cluster of nails at the thick
end. We took the girl to the bridegroom's
residence, where his people gave her the kindest
possible reception, and where she was duly
married to him next day.</p>

<p>On hearing of my share in this adventure my
mother was overwhelmed with grief and indignation.
However, I considered that I acted quite
rightly in the matter, and that in helping on the
marriage of a suffering fellow-man, which subsequently
turned out admirably, I did a piece of
good work.</p>

<p>The end of the autumn of this year was approaching,
and we prepared to transfer our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
residence from the country to our town-house.
My uncle, who represented our town in
the short-lived Ottoman Parliament in Constantinople,
had returned from that city just at
the same time, the said Parliament having been
prorogued indefinitely by the present Sultan,
and he had decided to reside in Angora for
some time. Hearing all about my conduct, he
asked my mother to send my luggage to his
house, so that I might live among his own
children, and pursue my studies under his personal
supervision. My mother, whose gentle
soul had been much disturbed by my countless
misdeeds, instead of being glad to see me go
away, when she might find a little peace, sobbed
on seeing my luggage removed from her house.
My uncle, as I inferred before, was the first
man in our family to enter the service of the
Government After acting as Judge in the
quasi-religious Mohammedan Courts of Aleppo,
Damascus, Cairo, Medina and Mecca, and
other centres of the Ottoman empire, for
nearly forty years, he retired temporarily from
the Government service. Although thoroughly
honest, sober, and pious in the extreme, he had
fallen into some of the old failings and habits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>of Constantinople officialdom, such as polygamy.
When I went to his house he had
three wives, all living together with their
numerous children and many female attendants,
in his harem&mdash;that is to say, in the ladies'
section of his house. His wives were all Circassians.
He bought, emancipated, and married
them at different times, and, unlike some other
polygamists, he kept them in one house. It
was as wonderful as uncommon to see how
they all obeyed him implicitly; and though a
man of the sternest disposition, he treated them
all kindly and with perfect fairness. They
may have hated one another at heart, but
etiquette and a strict ceremony of precedence
were always observed by them. The children
of the different wives were more markedly
jealous of each other than were their mothers.
Before marrying these three Circassian wives
my uncle had been married to a lady in
whose lifetime he could not take advantage
of the existence of the system of polygamy,
because she was the daughter of a family of
social distinction.</p>

<p>I lived in my polygamist uncle's harem
nearly two years. There was a marked con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>trast
between our own home life and that of
my uncle's tumultuous abode. The children
of his wives quarrelled with one another, his
servants quarrelled with each other. Each
wife looked after the comfort of her apartments
and her own children. I was not attached to
the department of any one of them, and felt
very unhappy. In every boyish dispute the
sons united and turned against me, and I was
quite naturally envious of the affection lavished
on them by their respective mothers. My
uncle, though he treated me on a perfect
equality with his own sons, was very strict
He gave us no rest. I lost all my former
amusements. We had to occupy ourselves
continually either with lessons or with the
prayers which he conducted five times a day in
a large hall. The morning prayers, which
have to be made about an hour before sunrise,
annoyed me more than the others, as every day
my uncle used to get up and go round knocking
at the door of every bedroom, both in the harem
and in the men's quarter, compelling everyone
to get up for the early prayer. To have to get
up and perform my prayer ablution on cold
winter mornings often made me complain in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>terms that were hardly pious. Anyone among
the numerous boys, girls, and servants who
failed in getting ready for the prayer without
being able to plead serious illness was sure to
receive the bastinado or whip from my stem
uncle. On several occasions, like his own sons,
I also received punishment Feeling depressed
in his house, I secretly started smoking, which
is strictly prohibited for boys in my country.
One of the sons, who disliked me much, one
day spied on me, and informed his father that
I was enjoying cigarettes in the stable in
company with the groom, who bought and kept
them for me, and shared them with me. My
uncle sent two stalwart servants to catch me.
They brought me before him, and he ordered
them to take off my shoes and socks and hold
my legs up. He gave me twenty strokes on
my bare feet, and they hurt me so much that I
howled for a long time afterwards. However,
the punishment had its effect, for till within the
last two years I have never been able to enjoy
smoking.</p>

<p>One of my uncle's strictest orders was that
his sons and I should remain on the men's side
of the house every evening to read and write
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>our lessons, and not retire to our rooms in the
harem to bed until after the evening prayer,
which takes place about ten o'clock. After I
had been living in his harem some months, one
night, at the moment when we were all preparing
to go to bed, my uncle asked me to
stop, and informed me, in his own grave
manner, that as I was entering upon the stage
of manhood, it was time that I should respect
the rule of seclusion. According to this rule,
a man can no longer live among the ladies of
the harem, between whom and himself marriage
would be legal. So the sons of my uncle
retired to the harem, leaving me behind in the
men's quarter of the house. I went to the
room assigned to me, and found all my belongings
had been brought out there. I have a
vivid recollection of the depression and sadness
I felt that night. I was not quite fifteen then.
I wished to run away to our own house and
throw myself into the arms of my mother, but
I knew it was quite hopeless, as I had been
legally placed under the guardianship of my
uncle alone. Moreover, he was too powerful a
man to be resisted, and his voice was supreme
in all matters connected with our family circle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>Seeing the hopelessness of my case, I wept
long that solitary night The reason which
necessitated my dismissal from my uncle's
harem was that he had two daughters of about
my own age. Some people, including my own
mother, used to design one of them for my
future wife, though I did not then appreciate
the blessing of matrimony, nor had the girl the
least liking for me. It is a curious fact that
when there is such a scheme to marry two
young people in the future, and even when
they are actually engaged, their separation, instead
of being relaxed, is more rigidly enforced.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">****</span></p>

<p>While on the subject of my uncle's harem,
it will not perhaps be amiss if I say something
about the practice of polygamy in general.
Much has been written in English about the
Islamic polygamy, but little that is correct
and authoritative, for those who are not
Mohammedans are unreasonably prejudiced
against it. Having more than one wife is not
a Turkish, but a Moslem custom. Among the
races of the Islamic faith the Turks indulge
in polygamy least Scratch those unprincipled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>officials in Constantinople who may be polygamists,
and you will find in them more foreign
than Osmanli blood. There are many reasons
for the justification of the plurality of wives in
the Islamic books. I will give one of these
reasons, which is historical. Before the time
of Mohammed some Arab tribes, in order to
check the increase of the female sex, used to
bury alive some of their, so to say, 'surplus
girls.' The appearance of Islam stamped out
this most savage custom. After the foundation
of Mohammedanism many sanguinary religious
wars took place between Islamites and non-Islamites
of Arabia, and a great number of
men died in the battles. Therefore many
women were left without husbands or unmarried.
In those days this caused the increase
of prostitution to an alarming degree, and this is
a great 'crime' according to the Mohammedan
law. Every fair-minded and impartial Christian
will admit that Mohammed established many
humane and just principles for his followers,
and it might be expected that such a wise man
would not have sanctioned the practice of
polygamy. But what could have been done
with those 'surplus women' in an age when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>women's services were not of any public
good to the community? How could he check
the "crime" of immorality? He had to permit
the exercise of polygamy, which was the usual
practice among other Semitic peoples; and he
sanctioned a man's marrying two, three, or
even four wives, according to his capability in
health, wealth, and just treatment of them.
"With the change of times laws must be
altered," says a general rule of Islamic law.
But polygamic law did not change. Some
wealthy and influential rulers and persons have
always favoured it. What surprises me most
in this respect is the injudicious criticism of
polygamy by some Europeans. Are there not
many men in Europe who, besides their lawful
wife at home, have paramours elsewhere?
This is worse than the polygamy of the Moslem
Orient, as in the one case the plurality of
female companions of life has a legal aspect,
and the issue of the union is considered legitimate,
while, on the other hand, the unfortunate
offspring of the <i>union libre</i> of Europe are disinherited
outcasts, and their mothers can at any
moment be thrown into prostitution.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are many people in England whose
ideas on the subject of the harem are but a
confused misconception, based on what they
may have heard about Eastern polygamy. In
this chapter, that I may correct these mistaken
conceptions, I will give some more exact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>information on the subject of the harem and
its inmates, as well as on the position of women
in Turkey in general.</p>

<p>Although the word harem is known and used
by the people of Western Europe, the true
meaning of the term is understood by but few
persons in this country. As a matter of fact,
many subjects concerning the East are much
misunderstood in the West, just as there are
certain manners and customs of Western
Europe that cause prejudice in the Eastern
mind. When an Englishman uses the word
harem, he means thereby the numerous wives
whom a man in our part of the East is supposed
to shut up in his house. He, moreover,
believes that every man in the Mohammedan
East may marry as many women as he pleases.
This idea is not only mistaken, but grotesque.
There are thousands of men who would consider
themselves fortunate if they could marry
even a single woman; while, on the other hand,
there are thousands who would be happy to
get rid of the single wife they have. Any man
who can manage to keep two, not to say more,
wives in peace, and can cope with the requirements
of each, must be an exceptionally brave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>person. Wives are not all religiously obedient
in the East, just as all men are not tyrants.
Religion, law, and custom impose upon men
many duties to be discharged towards their
wives. An honest man must discharge these
duties, and indeed it is very difficult to find
many men who are able to fulfil their obligations
as husbands towards more than one
wife. It has been proved that in many parts
of the Ottoman empire the number of women
does not exceed that of men, a fact which
alone is enough to show the absurdity of the
notion prevailing in England about the plurality
of wives in that country. As a matter of fact,
there is no law against the practice of polygamy,
but the feeling of decent people condemns
it A man who is once married to a
gentleman's daughter would find it no light
matter to add another wife to his home circle.
There are nowadays many men of Western
education who marry in order to find a life-companion,
and they quite understand that
were they so injudicious as to take another
wife, they would very likely render their lives
the reverse of peaceful.</p>

<p>After pointing out the absurdity of the notion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>that a man's harem is his collection of wives, I
will now explain what it really is.</p>

<p>In Mohammedan countries, where the seclusion
of women is a deeply rooted and religiously
observed custom, every house is divided into
two separate parts. In Turkey the section of
a house where the ladies reside is called the
harem, and the men's portion is named the
selamlik&mdash;that is to say, the reception-place.
Though the female inmates of a house are also
collectively called the harem, this does not
mean that they are all the wives of the master
of the house. A man's wife, his mother, his
sister, his daughter, and such other women as
may lawfully appear unveiled in his presence,
all belong to his harem.</p>

<p>The male members of a family who are permitted
to enter the harem are the master of
the house, his sons, his father, his father-in-law,
and his wife's brother. In large cities such
as Constantinople, Smyrna, and Adrianople, the
advanced class of people may even permit their
more distant relatives to enter. Those who
adopt European customs may even admit their
intimate friends. But in the old-fashioned
families, such as form the great bulk of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>population, no male relation of the master is
allowed to enter the harem portion of his house
after he has reached his thirteenth or fourteenth
year if marriage between such male relation
and the master's daughter, or other young
marriageable inmates of his house, be possible.</p>

<p>The restrictions are greater in the house of
the well-to-do. In these houses, all communication,
and sending and receiving parcels and
dishes between the inmates of the harem and
male members of the household, are effected
through a kind of turning cupboard. This
contrivance is fixed in a hole in the wall which
separates the harem apartments from the men's
quarter. As another measure to ensure the
seclusion of women, to the windows of all
harems is fastened a lattice; so while the
inmates can see everything outside from behind
this barrier, no man in the neighbouring streets,
gardens, and houses can see them. As boys
above the age of thirteen or fourteen are not
allowed to see any women except those very
near relatives I have enumerated, so girls, after
the same age, must not appear unveiled in the
presence of men, excepting their very near
relatives; and if they have been attending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>mixed schools, they will then be taken away; if
they go to girls' schools, they must go there, as
anywhere else, carefully veiled It must not be
supposed that the veils used are similar to the
light veils used by the ladies in this country. A
woman must go out wrapped from head to foot
in a long cloak, somewhat resembling a sheet.</p>

<p>The seclusion of women cannot be wholly
attributed to the precepts of the religion of
Islam. In the time of Prophet Mohammed, and
for generations after, women used to accompany
the armies to the battlefield, singing stirring
melodies to encourage the fighting men, and
tending those who were wounded. Even nowadays
among the tribal people, such as nomadic
Arabs, and among the Circassians, there is no
such absurdly strict seclusion of women as is
fostered by the harem system; yet those primitive
people are much more earnestly devoted
to that religion than the advanced Ottomans.
According to some of my countrymen who are
better judges than I am of these matters, the
custom of veiling women's faces so thickly was
adopted by the Ottomans from the Byzantine
Greeks, and I think it was man's despotic
jealousy in olden days which brought about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>the existing practice of covering up and veiling
women out of doors, and also their strict
seclusion in the houses.</p>

<p>The life in most Turkish harems is very
simple, and, if we leave out the case of the few
polygamists who still remain, very peaceful and
happy. The absolute authority of the husband
does not interfere with the recognised privileges
of the wife; while the obedience of the wife,
which is regarded by more advanced women in
Western Europe with such contempt, in most
cases strengthens the affection and respect of
the husband for her. Wives are not slaves of
their husbands, as some people in this country
fancy them to be.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> The inmates of harems live
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>mostly indoors, but they are not entirely shut up.
They go out in groups of two, three, and more
to pay visits to other harems, and they receive
visitors from the harems of friends and relations.
Of course their gatherings are almost always
unmixed, but, like the women of other countries,
some of them sing and play to entertain others.
Dancing has been introduced recently, but it is
confined only to very advanced private families.
Among the people of the old school the dancing
of young ladies in the presence of others is
considered shocking. At weddings and other
similar festivities only hired professional women
amuse the guests by dancing, and these professional
dancers are not regarded as respectable.
In my time, reading aloud was a favourite
pastime in many harems. The number of
educated women was much less than it is
now. The most learned among them used
to read sacred legends, or religious tracts,
or recite hymns to the other ladies, who
would listen attentively for hours. I believe
this social pastime is still in favour in the
provinces.</p>

<p>Turkish women, according to their social
position, have various duties to discharge. No
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>qualities are so much sought after in an average
marriageable woman as the domestic ones. In
the provinces the peasant women, besides
managing their humble domestic affairs, have
to work in the fields, more especially when their
brothers and husbands are away discharging their
compulsory military service. The daughters of
well-to-do people, besides attending to the
business of their households, are indefatigable
with their needles, and are always busy with
needlework or embroidery; while the daughters
of high dignitaries must, among other duties,
learn what their instructors or governesses
teach them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="i54" id="i54">
<img src="images/i_pg54fp.jpg" width="500" height="351" alt="A PICKNICKING RESORT." />
<span class="center">A PICKNICKING RESORT.</span></a></div>

<p>It will be understood from the details I have
given that the popular notion prevailing in
this country of the harem and the life in the
harem is much mistaken. Women in Turkish
harems do not really pass their time lying
on sofas or couches, eating sweetmeats and
smoking water-pipes all day long. Of course
they are as fond of sweetstuffs as most ladies
of this country. But to lie down on a
couch in presence of others is considered by
Turkish women vulgarity of the most disgraceful
kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>The representation of harem life given in
books and on the stage, or shown in exhibitions,
is either the work of Turkey's detractors,
or simply the work of imaginative persons who
know nothing about it, and whose object is to
attract the curiosity of English people by exhibiting
grotesque sights, and thus to make
money.</p>

<p>I should, however, agree with any English
critic in condemning the custom of seclusion.
The hopes which were entertained of checking
romantic evils by the custom have hardly been
realised; and on the other hand, the system has
done a good deal of harm, because the seclusion
of women means that a portion of the national
intellect is kept uncultivated. Although many
young ladies receive private tuition in the
harems, and many of them are highly educated,
yet this limited kind of education cannot meet
the national requirements of Turkey. In my
opinion, the strict seclusion of women is greatly
responsible for the backward condition of most
Eastern races; because if mothers are restricted
in cultivating their natural intellect, they can
give little if any help in the education of their
children. The sons of such mothers cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>keep pace with the people of Europe in the
path of progress. There are very many men
in Turkey who know all these things, and who
long for at least a partial emancipation. However,
the emancipation must take place gradually,
for if the liberty of men is given to the women
of the harems without regard to existing social
requirements, they themselves will not wholly
appreciate it, while many of them might abuse
its privileges; moreover, many men might take
unchivalrous advantage of so new and sudden
a social change.</p>

<p>I may be asked why, if the opinion of my
country is ripe enough for at least a partial
emancipation of women, it is necessary to withhold
it now? The reason can easily be found
when one reflects upon the political situation
of Turkey. That unhappy country has been
suffering for over twenty-six years from a
tyranny almost unparalleled in the history of
mankind. The Sultan understands perfectly
well the influence women might have in
educating and enlightening the rising generation.
He therefore puts the more restrictions
upon the movements of his women
subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>I cannot say much about the harem quarters
of princely palaces. It is well known, however,
that the happy family life enjoyed in the harems
of private gentlemen cannot be found in the
overcrowded harem of a palace. But I can
emphasise the fact that the numerous inmates
are not all the wives of the lord of the palace.
The vastness of domestic arrangements in such
an establishment must necessitate the employment
of many women as attendants. A sultan
or prince, if he resorts to the old rules of
polygamy, may marry two, three, and perhaps
four wives, but no more, as four is the highest
number allowed.</p>

<p>The wives of many well-to-do Ottomans and
all the inmates of the royal palaces of Turkey
are of Circassian origin. It may be asked why
Circassian women find so much favour, and
how it is these daughters of the Caucasus
adorn the family circle of Turkey? I will give
a brief account of them, which may explain
these points.</p>

<p>The Circassians, the fine, alert, and powerfully
built mountaineers who inhabit the most
picturesque regions of the Caucasus, have a
world-wide reputation for personal good looks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>and especially for feminine beauty. Those,
however, who have had any considerable
experience of this famous race might hesitate
to say that its women have really a larger
share of beauty as a whole than other branches
of the human race. What the Circassian
women do possess in distinction from those of
other races of Eastern Europe and Western
Asia is a greater animation of face, to which
may be added a figure uniformly handsome
and a bolder demeanour. They are for the
most part slender; a fat woman is quite uncommon
among Circassians of unmixed blood.
Their complexions are usually fair; and it is
more on account of her fair skin that the
Circassian woman is so much admired by the
comparatively dark people of Western Asia
and Egypt than for her other physical qualities.
She is also very readily taught, and adapts
herself quickly to her new surroundings; so
that, rustic and clumsy in her manners to begin
with, she picks up refined and elegant ways in
a remarkably short time. I knew of a wealthy
and kind lady who once obtained a young
Circassian girl from her relations. Though of
sympathetic appearance, this girl, whom I saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>at the time, looked an untamed creature in her
miserable ragged native dress. When I saw
her on another occasion after a few years'
interval, I found that the rough diamond had
been charmingly polished, and now shone with
refined beauty.</p>

<p>The Circassians are mostly Mohammedans.
A small number of them have been made to
accept the Russian religion, but these converts
have always a strong tendency towards the
faith of the Arabian Prophet; and it is only
the fear of the wrath of their conquerors that
prevents them from denouncing the doctrine
of Holy Synod. This tendency is attributable
either to the hatred burned into their hearts
towards the Muscovite on account of the destruction
of their national independence and
the loss of their primitive happiness, which has
resulted from the sanguinary and fiercely resisted
Russian conquest, or to the reason that
the precepts of Islam may perhaps suit their
native simplicity better.</p>

<p>There is Circassian blood in the veins of
almost all the members of the existing dynasties
of the Mohammedan Orient. For many generations
past the mothers of the Ottoman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>Sultans have been Circassians; just as in the
bygone centuries, when the power and influence
of Turkey were so great in Eastern Europe,
the Sultanas were women mostly belonging to
one or other of the Christian States which
were tributary to the Ottoman empire. Many
of the Mameluke rulers of Egypt were, as
well as their wives, Circassians. The female
members of the Khedivial harem have always
been and are still of Circassian origin, and
there are said to be Circassian ladies in the
household of the Persian sovereign.</p>

<p>The Nizam of Hyderabad was at one time
anxious to marry a Circassian woman. I
heard this from a man whose name is widely
known throughout India, and who, I believe,
has been introduced to English readers in a
well known novel under the fictitious name of
'Mr Isaacs.' This gentleman is a native of
Diarbekir, in Asiatic Turkey. After living
over thirty years in British India, he paid a
visit to Constantinople some nine years ago.
There, one day, he asked my advice as to how
he might procure Circassian slave-girls, saying
that he wished to buy one or two to be admitted
to the household of His Highness the Nizam.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>This anglicised gentleman imagined, as many
Englishmen do, that there is still a public
market for slave traffic in Constantinople, and
that anyone can go and purchase as many slave-women
as he pleases.</p>

<p>It is true that some destitute parents among
the refugees from the Caucasus are willing to
part with their young girls for a reasonable sum
of money, but only on obtaining a sufficient
guarantee beforehand that these young girls
will be adopted by the buyers (well-to-do
families without daughters often adopt orphans
and other poor girls), or else that the girls sold
in this fashion will be married either by the
buyers themselves or by some relation of
theirs.</p>

<p>From the moment of the final conquest of
their country by Russia up to the present time,
thousands of these natives of the Caucasus
have immigrated into the Sultan's dominions.
A short time ago there appeared a piece of
news in the papers, stating that an arrangement
had been made between Russian and
Ottoman authorities for the settlement in
Turkey of about sixty thousand more Circassians
who desired to leave the Caucasus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span><i>en masse</i>. Russia does not object to their
emigration nowadays, as she wishes to colonise
their land with peasants of the Russian race.
On the other hand, the Turkish Government
grants them facilities for settling in the thinly
inhabited portions of Asia Minor. The Circassians
are a healthy and hardy people, and
they improve the physical constitution of races
with whom they intermingle.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">****</span></p>

<p>An English reader will naturally want to
know how, in a state of affairs in which boys
and girls never meet after about their thirteenth
year, the matter of marriage is managed; I will
therefore explain the system of matrimony.</p>

<p>As is the case in most parts of the world, in
Turkish towns betrothal precedes marriage,
but 'courtship' is hardly possible in that
country. Young girls and men are not allowed
to meet one another, and consequently anything
in the way of flirting is out of the question. In
some exceptional cases they may, perhaps, be
able to get a glimpse of each other from a
distance, possibly from the windows of neighbouring
houses, and quietly exchange greetings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>or make signs of mutual admiration, but this
is all they can ever do in the direction of
flirtation. Of course, girls may see, though
they do not speak with, the men whose wives
they may be destined to become some day, but
men are strictly prohibited from meeting the
marriageable members of the secluded sex. It
is scarcely possible for a man to admire and love
a woman except on the testimony of others as
to her good looks and good qualities. In the
same way, the engagements must be made
through the medium of the man's lady-relations,
or through that of the professional marriage-brokers.
The latter are mostly old women, who
will endeavour to bring about marriages, not out
of good-will to the young couple or for the
sake of amusing themselves, but as a matter of
business. They visit houses where there are
girls suitable for a would-be bridegroom; they
make their proposal on his behalf to the family
of that young lady of whom they most approve,
a proposal which is made in a most roundabout
manner, and with great tact. The answer
must not come from the prospective bride;
that would be considered highly improper. The
decision rests with her parents or guardians.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>She is, no doubt, consulted, but her voice in
the matter is of secondary importance. Probably,
too, she does not know her own mind so
well as do her sisters in more advanced lands.
The matrimonial agent often repeats her visits
three or four times that the matter may be well
talked over, as the girl's people need to reflect,
and also to make a searching inquiry about the
man. If the answer be in the negative, it must
be made very tactfully and politely. In some
parts of Turkey they have a curious way of
letting the proposers know that their offer has
been declined. Over their ordinary shoes
people almost always wear goloshes, and on
entering a house they take them off and leave
them in the entrance-hall. The servants of
the house make a point of arranging the
goloshes heel outwards, in such a way that
when the visitor goes out he can put his feet
straight into them, without having the trouble
of turning them round. Now, when the agent
of suitor for a lady's hand, on leaving the
house, finds that her goloshes are turned with
the toes towards her, she knows that the proposal
has been declined.</p>

<p>Thus a man gets betrothed to a woman with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>out
being permitted to see his beloved fiancée
until the wedding formalities are over and the
marriage ceremonies are completed. Astounding
tales have been related of what has sometimes
happened when a husband has thus seen
his wife for the first time. In one town, a man
who, from the reports he had heard, was deeply
in love with his betrothed, actually left the
house and ran away when he drew up the long
and beautifully embroidered veil that covered
the lady, now his wife, and discovered that she
was the ugliest creature his imagination could
picture. It is easy to conceive the feelings in
such a case of a man who has, on the flattering
descriptions of the professional marriage-brokers,
been led to believe up to the last
moment in the angelic appearance of his wife.
How terrible must be his disappointment when,
on the day of his marriage, he unveils his
dreamt-of 'beauty' and beholds a face rough
and painted in the vain endeavour to conceal the
ravages of smallpox, or distinguished by an
ultra-Israelitish nose and topped with a pretentious
wig. The unhappy case of such a
disappointed husband must not, however, be
overstated. Fortunately for him he does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>often see other female faces, and his notions on
the subject of what real beauty is are necessarily
restricted by his want of experience. He is
naturally of a contented disposition, believes in
kismet in this as in other things, and so these
physical defects do not greatly disturb his peace
of mind, and it is only very rarely that he runs
away from his wife.</p>

<p>Such matters as courtship and engagements
are quite different among the agricultural and
tribal people, where the girls and boys work
together in the fields, in the gardens and pastures,
and thus pass their early years in each other's
society; their marriage in later years is
generally the outcome of natural affection, first
awakened by that companionship. But even in
the towns it is sometimes possible for a man to
make the acquaintance of a woman before
marrying her. This is done by the betrothed
pair arranging a secret interview, which, it is
said, is usually brought about with the kind
assistance of old and trusted servants.
Curiously enough, the professional marriage-broker
is sometimes reported to be the person
who arranges this private interview; but one
thing is absolutely certain, namely, that unless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>she is handsomely tipped, it is to her own
advantage to stick strictly to the good old
custom.</p>

<p>The wedding of a young couple itself, like
their betrothal, takes place in an indirect manner.
They are married in a house privately, in
the presence of persons closely related to them.
They do not go to any place of worship. As I
pointed out before, the houses in Turkey are
divided into two parts, one reserved for the
male, the other for the female members of the
household, and there is a long passage between
the two. On the wedding-day the ladies fill up
the passage, having in front of them the bride,
while all the gentlemen present go to the room
in the men's department which opens on to the
passage, the prominent figure among them
being the bridegroom. The door between the
passage and the room is closed, and the most
profound silence must prevail both in the
passage and the adjacent room. Among the
gentlemen, the father of the bride, or, failing
him, any elderly man under whose guardianship
or protection she may be, gets up, knocks at
the door, and most solemnly and impressively
asks this question, "My daughter! we are about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>to marry you to Mr. So-and-so, in accordance
with the will of Almighty God and the ordinances
of the Prophet. Will you marry him?"
She gives no answer. The old man repeats
the question; still she does not utter a single
syllable. He asks again in a wearied manner,
and this time the question is followed by a
sound of sobbing inside the passage. Whether
the reason of this weeping be the pressure put
upon the shy and inexperienced girl in that
impressive moment, or whether it be the pinches
she receives from that termagant, the professional
marriage-broker, and from her mischievous
girl-friends who urge her to speak out, I cannot
tell.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the bridegroom grows impatient;
everyone in the audience can notice the signs
of anger and anxiety on his face. The old man
repeats his question a fourth time, and at last
the word of consent is uttered in a very low
voice from behind the door. At the same
moment the bridegroom shows his feelings of
relief by some motions expressive of pleasure,
or by looking more than usually gratified. The
old gentleman turns to him and formally asks
him whether he will marry Miss So-and-so.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>He makes no modest hesitation, as, in his
opinion, modesty is quite uncalled for here, is,
in fact, an unpleasant outcome of the organised
hypocrisy of society. So he answers the old
gentleman's question at once, with the unblushing
boldness peculiar to his sex. After this all
the audience bear witness to the legitimacy of
the event. A brief prayer is then recited, after
which all offer their congratulations to the
bridegroom. They draw up and sign the
wedding-contract immediately, that it may be
certified by the semi-religious magistrate called
the Kadi. But the young couple are not permitted
to see each other till all the marriage
ceremonies are completed, and that is not till
several days have passed.</p>

<span class="center">A VILLAGE WEDDING PROCESSION.</span></a></div>

<p>Another curious custom connected with
marriage is that of a bridegroom's friends
beating him on the back with their fists. This
is commonly the case in Turkey. At the very
moment when the bridegroom is going to see
the face of his wife the first time, after all
formalities of the wedding are over, intimate
friends and relations collect just outside the
door of the female portion of the house. After
wishing him a happy life, they belabour him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>from behind as he hurries into the ladies
quarter, a proceeding which no doubt considerably
accelerates his movements. The punishment
is supposed to be inflicted in a gentle
manner, but it may perhaps be that some of
the young bachelors relieve their feeling of
jealousy by making the customary blows somewhat
harder than absolutely necessary.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">****</span></p>

<p>Before closing this chapter on the theme of
the secluded sex, I ought to say something of
the way in which it does its shopping, and give
some description of the women-pedlars who
visit the harems to display their wares. There
are probably few people in this country, even
among those who are interested in the world's
trade, who know much about these female
traders of the East. Nevertheless, in those
vast tracts of the Orient where the female sex
passes its life in strict seclusion, a considerable
retail business of a primitive kind is transacted
by wandering women-pedlars, who carry their
goods round and display them in the houses of
well-to-do families. Originally this trade was
carried on entirely by native women, but of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>late a certain number of European women have
embarked in it, either on their own account or
as agents of small European houses. At a
time when the question of spreading British
commercial interests abroad is attracting so
much attention, it may not be amiss to inquire
into this method of trading, which, more than
any other in the world, is the prerogative of
women, for they alone can engage in it
Of course, the business lies almost entirely
among the families of Mohammedans, of whom
it is estimated that Great Britain has nearly a
hundred million among her subjects; it is also
probable that the future will see this number
largely increased. Moreover, in the territories
of other powers, where the populations are
largely Mohammedan, this country has vital
trade interests. A lesson is to be learned from
missionaries in pushing British commerce in
the East. A very large proportion of the
success in Oriental countries gained by
missionaries is due to the ladies who assist
them, for naturally they alone can get at the
women of the East What applies to the
spread of religion applies also to the spread
of trade, and the work done by the Zenana
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>Missions should be a sufficient indication of what
a trading association on the same lines could
effect. Equally it should show the British
commercial houses which have considerable
connections with the East that lady agents to
display and sell their goods would be of great
assistance to them. There are many Mussulman
women who cannot go to markets and
shops, and their custom would be practically
assured to the firms which sent goods to their
houses by lady agents, more especially such
goods as are required for household use.</p>

<p>In Turkey, Roman Catholic nuns have
already adopted this method of business, and
they have numerous customers among Mohammedan
women for the woollen stuffs, cloth,
stockings, shawls, and such things, which they
make in their own convents. The need felt by
Mohammedan families for such means of doing
their shopping is very great, and is rapidly
becoming greater owing to the spread of
European influence and refinement, which
naturally necessitates an increase of household
requirements and personal luxuries. This
adoption of Western comfort and modes of
life does not seem to affect the seclusion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>Oriental women to the extent that was at one
time expected. And in any case in the East
women depend on others to a great extent for
procuring all the things they require for themselves
and their households.</p>

<p>It is true, of course, that husbands, brothers,
and sons can be sent to buy these things, just
as in England, but also, just as in England,
husbands, brothers, and sons cannot always be
relied upon either to get the right article, or
even to remember to get anything at all. In
any case the method has many disadvantages.</p>

<p>With the exception of villagers and the
poorest classes, only women of advanced ideas
ever go to market or to the shops in the large
towns, and even they do not and cannot know
the delights of shopping. They are veiled, to
begin with; and being unaccustomed to talk to
strangers, they are not at their ease or quite
satisfied with the propriety of their proceedings.
No; the woman of the East much prefers to
do her shopping in her own house from a
woman-pedlar, and there it is rumoured that
she feels as much pleasure in it as her sister
of the West</p>

<p>'The Unchanging East' is a phrase used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>often, and shows the user's ignorance, for the
East is changing steadily. Western methods
and ideas are gradually being accepted, and
with them the everyday needs and requirements
which accompany them. Home manufacture
is unable to supply these needs, and
there is a constant and growing demand for
European products. We ourselves have often
had to send from France and England to
our friends in Turkey, Cyprus and Syria, such
things as pocket-knives, scissors, housewives,
and work-baskets, articles required for education,
such as drawing-boxes, and last, but
not least, children's toys. But this was not
enough; our friends have generally written to
us to get some more of these things for their
friends.</p>

<p>No doubt such articles can be obtained in
Oriental countries if you know where to look
for them, but our friends do not know, and
they are not to be found in the stock of the
woman-pedlar. Here is an opening for the
lady-trader.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> residence in my uncle's home in Asia Minor
did not last very long after my removal from
his harem, as he decided to go to Constantinople
to live there again. Of course I was to go
with his family, so that I might continue my
education. Everyone in my uncle's house
began to pack, and my mother prepared new
clothes and all kinds of eatables for me for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>journey, which would take seven days. My
uncle did not permit me to go to my mother's
house and spend my few remaining days with
her. I only went to see her during the daytime,
when I found her always in deep distress
at the thought of our approaching separation.
She had only one son remaining, a child of two
years, my elder brother having been sent to the
same place to which I was going for the same
purpose two years previously. In those days
there was no railway line between my native
town and the Asiatic coast of the Sea of
Marmora, so our journey had to be made in
a kind of a four-wheeled travelling carriage,
which was introduced into Turkey by the
emigrant Crimean Tartars, and which much
resembles the big vans employed for carrying
parcels in London. Travelling in these coaches
is an extremely uncomfortable proceeding. To
guard against the jolting caused by the lack of
adequate springs the floor of the vehicle is
covered with mattresses, but even then the
shaking is quite insufferable. In those days it
was made worse by the primitive condition of
the roads, which indeed are little better now.
Some fifteen years ago the Government pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>mulgated
a law ordering every able-bodied
male throughout the country to work four days
a year at making public roads between towns,
or to pay a workman's wage for four days in
default. Some well-meaning governors did
their best to improve the roads, but officials nominated
by the palace, who form the majority
of officialdom, abused this law and pocketed
the funds raised, and so a great part of the
public roads were ultimately left unfinished,
and no care was taken to keep in repair even
the portions that were completed. Good roads,
like other means of easy travelling, would
facilitate the incursion of visitors and tourists
into the interior of Asiatic Turkey, and nothing
would be more repugnant to the Sultan than to
see this; and again, nothing would be more
undesirable for the Sultan and his entourage
than to see parties of Englishmen and Americans
wondering at the unopened, undeveloped spots
of the country, coming directly into contact
with his subjects, and contrasting their poverty-stricken
and wretched condition with the natural
beauty and richness of the land in which they
live.</p>

<p>The appointed day at last arrived, and we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>started for Constantinople in the jolting van-like
coaches, of which we hired twelve, seven
being assigned to the ladies and their luggage,
and five to the men. As is necessary for
travellers of position who may carry valuables
with them, we had three gendarmes put at our
disposal by the local authorities. This was a
precaution against brigands, who are to be met
with every now and then in the thinly inhabited
and mountainous regions of Asiatic Turkey.
It hardly ever happens, however, that these
brigands are Turks. Ever since the days of
the Crusaders the ill-informed section of the
European public has manifested a prejudice
against the Turks, and as one result of this
prejudice therefore, when reports are heard in
Europe of cases of brigandage occurring in
Turkey, it is unhesitatingly concluded that the
brigands must be Turks. As a matter of fact,
the provincial Turk is generally an honest
fellow. It was not the Turkish villagers that
we feared; nor did we fear the Kurds, who
mostly infest the Eastern portion of Asia Minor;
or the Greeks, of whom the provinces through
which we had to pass were fairly clear. Our
precautions were directed against any possible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>attack from the emigrant settlers, the majority
of whom are Circassians.</p>

<p>According to our day's itinerary, we had to
pass the first night in a small town which we
expected to reach after thirteen hours' travelling.
But before we had got half-way our drivers
said that they did not want to over-fatigue their
horses, and as the ladies expressed a wish not
to journey after nightfall, we stopped at a small
village. We found it difficult to get a sufficient
number of rooms there, and we were too
numerous to be the guests of any of the village
dignitaries, who, though invariably hospitable,
were not sufficiently well-off to maintain so
large a party.</p>

<p>Hospitality is an inborn instinct in most of
the Turkish villagers. They love entertaining
passing strangers, and they expect nothing in
return for the trouble they take on their visitors'
behalf. This fact has often been mentioned by
Europeans who have travelled in Asia Minor.
But the inhabitants of the village where we
passed our first night did not show us much
sympathy. People in these parts, however,
have good reason for not being very hospitable.
All officials who are appointed to this province
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>by the Sultan&mdash;and they have usually large
families&mdash;claim hospitality for themselves and
for their families as they travel to and fro from
Constantinople, and they imagine that by so
doing they force the "loyal slave-subjects" of
the Sultan to perform their duty. Although my
uncle was an official, he would not have dreamt
of imposing any obligation upon poor villagers,
for he was himself a native of Asia Minor, and
naturally did not wish to inconvenience his
compatriots. We induced, however, some of
the villagers to spare a few rooms in their mud
huts. I and three other men had to sleep in a
dimly-lighted loft above a stable in which were
several bullocks, calves, and donkeys. I think
some English travellers have had the same
experience before now in Asia Minor, and they
generally complain of the unpleasantness of
these lofts, and of the noise and effluvia from
the animals. I did not object to these things
much, as I was used to farm life; moreover, I
have heard and almost believe that sleeping in
stables is good for the health. Tired to death
by journeying in a shaky van, I was ready to
fall asleep at once, but hundreds of fleas, coming
perhaps from the dusty floor of the loft or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>falling from the thatch above, made an assault
on me, and rendered sleep impossible. I wanted
to go out to our van, taking a carpet with me
to lie on, but when I got out I saw three huge
shepherd's dogs lying near the vans, so I did
not dare to leave the stable door.</p>

<p>These fierce dogs are especially trained to be
savage in order to guard the sheep and mohair
goats against thieves and wolves. They would
tear to pieces any stranger who might walk
through the village at night. They are powerfully
built animals, mostly light-yellow and grey
in colour, with long silky coats. Mohair goat
breeders always fasten round the neck of these
dogs chain collars studded with sharp nails,
because when wolves attack them they invariably
try to seize the dogs by the neck or
throat, and the studded collars act as preventive
armour against the teeth of the assailant.</p>

<p>After passing the night in that most uncomfortable
village, we started for the next
town. We followed the travellers' custom in
quartering at the house of one of the notables,
and enjoying the national hospitality I have
mentioned. In towns this sort of hospitality to
travellers can only be given when host and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>guest are personally acquainted, or when the
latter can produce letters of introduction from
some friends of the host.</p>

<p>On the third night of our journey we had
arranged to stay in a Turcoman village, but we
found that the people of the village had shut up
their huts, and had removed, with all their belongings,
to some high pasture land in the
vicinity, where there were several lovely springs.
We went to this spot and spent the night
there under three tents, which were woven
from the hair of black goats, and which were
lent to us by these quasi-nomadic people
for the night. In return for this we tendered
them money, but they were affronted by this
offer, so we gave them 'some presents from
town.'</p>

<p>We spent the fourth night in a large inn, for
there was nothing there worthy of the name of
hotel. As a matter of fact, except in a few big
towns on the coasts and on the existing railway
lines, there are no hotels where it is possible to
be tolerably comfortable. The average houses
calling themselves hotels, of which many are
being built in the crowded centres, and conducted
by native Christians, are in reality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>nothing more than taverns, where the appearance
of drunkards is a continual shock to the
feelings of sober Ottoman families who may
need to put up at these places when travelling.
If they cannot secure a letter of introduction to
some dignitary of a town for the night, they
would rather go to an old-fashioned khan, or inn,
than to one of these modern taverns. Rooms
in these inns are unfurnished, and usually
filthy beyond description. All kinds of vermin
may be expected, and even the visit of an
occasional scorpion.</p>

<p>After passing two more nights on our journey,
on the sixth evening we reached the town of
Broussa, which is situated at the foot of the
Asiatic Olympus. We stopped in Broussa
several days, as the town is full of pretty
mosques, shrines, and mausoleums, and large
baths built over thermal springs, which are well
worth seeing. Broussa is one of the largest
towns in the Turkish empire. It served as
capital for the first three Ottoman Sultans. It
is said that when the Sultan Mohammed II.
conquered Constantinople he brought nearly
50,000 Turkish families from Broussa to settle
in the new capital. From Broussa we went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>down to the shore of Marmora, and there took
boat for Constantinople.</p>

<p>The part of Stamboul in which my uncle
took up his residence was in the neighbourhood
of the great mosque of Mohammed II., the
conqueror of Constantinople. This is the
centre of the locality which is exclusively inhabited
by Turkish families of the old-fashioned
type. My cousins and I were given two weeks'
holiday by my uncle in which to explore the city
and see the sights. One day we were allowed
to go over the Golden Horn to visit Pera, the
European quarter of the capital, where we
were amazed at the evident signs of the prosperity
and richness of its population. While
we were enviously imagining how happy these
people must be, an old man, who was guiding
our little party, warned us that to set our
ambitions on such worldly progress was not in
accordance with the ideals of contentment of
the faithful, and reminded us that "This world
is the heaven of infidels." This saying, which
is wrongly attributed to the Prophet, is one of
the principles of that fatalism, the firm belief
in which is one of the chief reasons for the
stationary condition and want of progress which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>distinguish the majority of Orientals. On
coming back from Pera, however, we received
quite a different impression, for we witnessed
the seamy side of European life. The
larger portion of the European quarter is
inhabited by Greeks, Poles, Levantines, Italians
and Maltese. Here may be seen dirty cut-throats
with crime written large on their faces,
and, above all, many an habitual drunkard,
whose face tells the tale of his debauched
life. Here, too, we saw disreputable houses,
with half-naked and painted creatures sitting on
their balconies or standing on the thresholds of
their doors, and calling out invitations to all
who passed by. Here we saw countless drink
and dram shops, all filled with rough sailors,
Greek thieves, quarrelsome Maltese, and the
dregs of European society. They were all more
or less drunk, most of them openly armed with
daggers and revolvers. None of these ruffians
would dream of obeying the law of the country
and its police, for each of them enjoys his
capitulation privileges, and thus is under the
protection of the Embassy and Consulate of
his country, whatever it may be. We were
disgusted with such an exhibition of what most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>Moslems believe to be "Christian life." It is
unfortunately a fact that all the bad points of
European civilisation spread with ease and
rapidity, while its good and useful points seem
seldom to have any effect on life in Oriental
countries.</p>

<span class="center">TURKISH CEMETERY</span></a></div>

<p>After this excursion I was not permitted to
revisit the European quarter of the capital for
a considerable time. I had to resume the course
of my education.</p>

<p>In what way my cousins and I should be
educated in Constantinople was a question
which had to be considered by my uncle.
There are two kinds of higher education in
Turkey. One of them is to receive instruction
in the old-fashioned colleges or <i>madrasseh</i>, of
which I have made mention before, and of
which I will in this chapter give some further
description. The other form of education is
that now carried on in the modern schools and
colleges. Of these there are many in Constantinople.
They are modelled on the system of
the educational institutions of some of the
European countries. In these places of learning,
unlike the old-fashioned <i>madrasseh</i>, all
kinds of what I may call utilitarian subjects,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>necessitated by modern requirements, are
taught In addition to the great military
academy and preparatory military colleges,
naval college, civil and military medical institutions,
and the Imperial lycée, some of
which are fifty or sixty years old, there are
civil servants', law, civil-engineering, and
several minor colleges of recent foundation.
Two years ago an official project was in the
air for creating a regular University in Constantinople.
But the present Sultan is not
likely to favour in earnest such a scheme, which
would necessarily result in the increased
popularity of European culture. Formerly
those colleges of modern creation turned out
men of marked ability in all branches of literature
and science which existed in the country.
But, unhappily, Abd-ul-Hamid's inflexible
determination to suppress at any cost what are
called 'young-Turkish ideas,' or liberalism, has
seriously interfered with and paralysed the
progress of these seminaries of culture and
education.</p>

<p>My desire was to join one of these colleges,
after having been prepared by private tuition to
pass the obligatory entrance examination. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>since my elder brother had already entered one
of the modern colleges, my uncle urged me to
affiliate myself to one of the old-fashioned
<i>madrassehs</i>. As we had yet some hope of
recovering our confiscated property, and as the
right of holding the estates depended on the
heir's following our grandfather's semi-theological
profession, my uncle insisted that I
should continue my studies in one of these
quasi-theological <i>madrassehs</i>. Although I was
most reluctant, I had to fall in with his wishes,
so I prepared to go and live with a tutor who
had his room in the <i>madrasseh</i> which is attached
to the mosque of little St Sophia,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> a
Byzantine building, which is as much visited by
European tourists as the great St. Sophia.
When one becomes a member of these old-fashioned
institutions of learning, one must
wear a professional turban and a long cloak, let
the beard grow, if one is old enough to have
one, and shave the hair off one's head. They
procured for me a turban and cloak, and my
uncle sent me with a manservant to a barber's
shop to get my head shaved. The shaving of
a thick head of hair is a most painful thing, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>tears filled my eyes, partly from the pain caused
by the razor on my unaccustomed head, and
partly, I think, from the anticipation of the
terrible monk-like existence I was about to pass
in the <i>madrasseh</i>. Next day I went with my
luggage to the school, but did not begin my
studies until several months had passed away,
as I caught cold by being shaved, and suffered
in consequence from headache and ophthalmia.
I shall never forget the miserable life I passed
in that school. It will perhaps be of some
interest if I give a description of a <i>madrasseh</i>,
and the mode of life and study therein.</p>

<p>There are in Constantinople over a hundred
of these theological colleges, or <i>madrassehs</i>.
In the provinces each important town is provided
with several. These seminaries of old
Moslem culture are not peculiar to Turkey&mdash;they
exist also in Egypt, Persia, and some
other Oriental countries, and at one time they
were the only places of instruction. They
served not only as schools for religious teaching
when they were originally founded in past days,
but all branches of human knowledge known in
the East were to be taught in them. In Constantinople
some of them still retain their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>original names&mdash;'<i>Madrasseh</i> of Medicine,'
'Madrasseh of History,' and so on. The
Moslem people were formerly divided into two
distinct classes&mdash;the great illiterate mass, and
the learned hierarchy known as <i>Ulema</i>. Although
all instruction given in the <i>madrasseh</i>
was formed on the basis of the faith of Islam,
the <i>Ulema</i> were certainly not entirely theologians.
They were certainly not priests, as
Islam recognises no spiritual authority. Mohammed
has stated distinctly that "there is no
priesthood in Islam." With the lapse of time
human knowledge advanced, and the high
culture which existed among Moslems in
mediæval times decayed; but still the <i>Ulema</i>
continued to teach the Arabic language, with
its literature and law, secular and spiritual.
Ultimately countries like Turkey and Egypt
felt the necessity of learning something from
the progressive nations of Europe, and, in imitation
of their educational institutions, began
to establish schools and colleges for modern
learning and science. In the Ottoman empire
the <i>Ulema</i>, having nearly lost their occupations
as professors and judges, now hold a peculiar
position, which somewhat resembles a sort of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>priesthood. Of course, this class still retains
its old professional titles, receives pensions, and
lives on the revenues accruing from charitable
endowments. Moreover, its members still have
a greater influence over the ignorant masses
than persons of modern education, but they
are not now of much service to the State. The
<i>madrassehs</i> are, notwithstanding, still full of
students who wish to become members of that
body, but the more intelligent of them, instead
of attending the old course of lectures in the
mosques, go to some modern college in order
to qualify themselves for professions which will
be of practical use to them. Many of them
spend their time in the <i>madrassehs</i> idly, or
simply live in them till they have passed an
examination by which they are exempted from
military service, and then return to their towns
and villages. Again, some of these students
who are really working, instead of attending
one of the modern colleges, go to an institution
founded for the training of the <i>Kadis</i> or semi-religious
magistrates. These students are all
called <i>Softas</i>. All the affairs of the <i>madrassehs</i>
are under the control of the office of the Sheikh-ul-Islam,
which, though it still forms a distinct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>ministry, and though the Sheikh-ul-Islam is still
a member of the Cabinet of the Porte, has lost
many of the important official functions it once
had. The position of the Sheikh-ul-Islam, the
head of the <i>Ulema</i>, at present resembles that
of the ecclesiastical head of a Christian country,
though, as I stated before, no ecclesiastics could
be recognised as such in Islam. The number
of the students in the <i>madrassehs</i> of Constantinople
is estimated to be something between
five and seven thousand.</p>

<p>Originally the <i>madrassehs</i> were founded on
a system much resembling that of the colleges of
the English Universities. They were built by
the munificence of the Sultans and of private
persons, and most of them were situated near
mosques, to which they were attached, and were
supported from the same endowments as the
mosques themselves, for the charitable founders
of these endowments aimed particularly at increasing
the congregations that attend public
worship, and devised that the students should
also use the mosques as their lecture-halls.
Even nowadays most lectures are given in the
mosques. Each <i>madrasseh</i> was self-governing,
and the principals, or, so to say, the 'fellows,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>used to look after its interests and decide its
rules. All the students used to be regularly
supplied with soup, bread, and, on certain days,
with cooked rice, and a kind of sweet made
of saffron, and also with olive oil for their
lamps, from a sort of kitchen endowed for the
purpose. Free 'commons' of this sort for
students are supplied only occasionally and
sparsely nowadays, as the revenues of the
endowed estates and properties have long been
put under the care and control of officialdom,
and the income from charities is now abused
and illegally appropriated by the corrupt and
impious hands through which it passes. In
consequence, members of the <i>madrassehs</i> now
can often not even raise funds to save their
buildings from complete ruin. These buildings
are mostly square in shape, with a courtyard
in the middle, and have one and sometimes
two stories. They are unhealthy, and
cannot be properly ventilated. The students
take their baths behind the doors of their
rooms, cook their meals in the fireplace, and,
as a rule, two or three sleep in one room,
on the floor. The damp, f&#339;tid smell in most
of the rooms is terrible. My hard fate made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
me live five years in such a place, and they
were the years which ought to be the best
of one's youth.</p>

<p>The life of the students of these <i>madrassehs</i>
resembles that of monks in monasteries of the
Eastern Church. They prepare their own
modest food, clean their own rooms, make their
own beds, and wash their own clothes. A new
student not only does all this for himself, but
he has also to do it for the fellow or tutor of
the <i>madrasseh</i> in whose room he is placed.
Most of the students are very poor. They
go every year during the <i>ramadan</i>&mdash;the month
of fasting&mdash;to different provincial towns and
villages to preach, to teach, and to do some
writing for the illiterate villagers and provincials,
and, after securing what fees, alms, and provisions
they can get, they return to their respective
madrassehs to resume their work.</p>

<p>The <i>Softas</i> played a conspicuous part in
some of the revolutions, for if once they were
roused and egged on by politicians, they
would assemble in the courtyards of the great
mosques, bearing yataghans and heavy clubs
under their long cloaks, and numberless common
people would follow them. The viziers who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>deposed the late Sultan Aziz had to get the
support of the <i>Softas</i>. Midhat Pasha had to
secure their assistance when he was urging the
present Sultan to sanction the scheme for the
new constitution. A certain Suavi Effendi, one
of the founders of the young-Turkish movement,
who had himself been a <i>Softa</i>, twenty-five
years ago made an armed attack on the
Sultan's palace; with him fought and fell many
of the <i>Softas</i>. The Sultan, whose marvellous
power and success in crushing everything which
might endanger his despotic personal rule is
undeniable, has paralysed the collective influence
of the Softas, so that they can no longer
be the political tools of any power that may
arise to oppose him.</p>

<p>During my residence in the <i>madrasseh</i> my
uncle used to give me as pocket-money twenty
piastres (about 3s. 5d.) a month, and to the
tutor of the <i>madrasseh</i>, in whose room I was
a novice-disciple, eighty piastres, to cover the
expenses of my maintenance. This was quite
enough for a man who has to live as abstemiously
and simply as a monk. Moreover, provisions
in Constantinople are very cheap, a
fact which is not known to European visitors,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>who are invariably cheated by the Levantine and
Greek hotel-keepers and tradesmen. Secretly,
however, I received further support from my
affectionate mother, through an Armenian
merchant who came from Angora.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> living the hard life of the <i>madrasseh</i> for
three solitary years, I was permitted by my
uncle to pay a visit to my native town during
a vacation. It was at this time that my prejudice
against the unbelievers of Europe first
began to be moderated, and it came about in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>this way. During a summer afternoon, as I
was walking in the garden of the <i>madrasseh</i>,
a young European, accompanied by a pretty
girl, was just coming out of the mosque of
little St Sophia. They excited my curiosity,
as the appearance of all Europeans who came
to visit those ancient edifices always excites
the curiosity of the people living near them.
They both looked at a mulberry tree loaded
with fruit, and the gentleman picked up a berry
which had just fallen and gave it to the lady.
I walked towards them, with what possibly
was a rather forbidding air. They started, and
appeared somewhat embarrassed. I signed to
them to stop, and, taking off my shoes, climbed
up the tree and picked a handful of the ripe
fruit. I put the fruit on two large leaves of
the tree and offered it to the lady. My action
seemed to please them. They had no guide,
which pleased me greatly, for there are no
more shameless cheats than those ignorant
interpreters, who are as a class one of the worst
products of the non-Mussulman natives of the
Levant Many Europeans who pay a flying
visit to the Levant, and hasten to sit down and
write a book about their experiences, derive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>all their information from these cicerones and
interpreters. Probably it is on account of this
that a countryman of mine once remarked,
"When we read such books, especially those
written in English, about ourselves, we always
learn something from them which we never
knew or heard of before." As the English
were respected above all other European nations
in those days in the Ottoman empire, and as
everyone used to think every European visitor
must be English, I took the couple for English
people. Whether they were really British or
not is an open question. We exchanged a
parting greeting, but to my regret I did not
speak any language then except my own, in
which I might try to talk to them. From that
moment, however, my mind was possessed by
a desire to see England, though I could not
mention it to anyone, because the people of
the <i>madrasseh</i> would have been greatly shocked
by such a suggestion, and would perhaps have
brought a charge against me of wishing to turn
myself into a Christian.</p>

<p>I started soon after this for home. The
party with which I travelled took a route
different from the one by which we had come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>three years previously to Constantinople. I
therefore had the opportunity of visiting other
towns of Asia Minor. When I reached our
own town, I found that my mother had already
moved to her summer house in the country.
By a strange coincidence, the British Consul
and his family were staying in a summer
residence which they had hired close by our
own. They were the only English people,
and also the only Europeans, to be found in
the town, as the Anatolian railway was not
then even projected, and no European could
possibly have found any employment there.
I made the acquaintance of the Consul one
day while shooting wild-duck on the shores
of a neighbouring lake. The British Consul
was able to make himself understood in
Turkish, and we soon struck up an acquaintance.
I made him promise to meet me again,
so that we might go shooting together. When
I became more intimate with him, I was
privileged by an introduction to his wife, who
did not associate at all with the ladies of the
country. A wish crossed my mind soon after
that my mother and she should meet. This
was a most delicate matter, because, though I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>found the lady very charming, after all, from
my mother's point of view, she was an
'infidel.' However, I secured her consent,
and she met the English lady with a considerable
amount of shyness. On account of the
Englishwoman's inability to speak Turkish
sufficiently, they talked very little. Notwithstanding
this, my mother liked her visitor
greatly, and she afterwards repeatedly expressed
to me her regret that such a nice
woman should not be a follower of 'the true
religion of God,' that is to say, Islam. I used
to ask many questions of the Consul about his
country, and I think my inquiries must have
been of the most ridiculous description, for
while they answered me most kindly, wife and
husband exchanged words in their own tongue
and smiled the whole time. I was so afraid of
the prejudices of my people that I did not even
venture to express to the Consul my then most
unrealisable desire of visiting England.</p>

<p>When the three months' vacation given to
me that year came to an end, I started for
Constantinople again. Having gained sufficient
seniority in the <i>madrasseh</i> I was now
free from serving any tutor. I had a room
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>which I shared with an Albanian fellow-pupil.
That year I made progress in the study of
Mohammedan law, which is always taught in
the Arabic language. Two more years passed.
The next summer vacation I wanted to see
some new country, so I took a French liner for
Beyrout, where I had a relation. On my way
I stayed at Smyrna, and visited the Turkish
islands of Chios and Mitylene. During my
travels I saw many young men who, having
completed their studies in modern colleges,
had been appointed by the Government to
various posts in the provinces, with salaries
which at that time seemed to me higher than
could have been expected by any young man.
An idea crossed my mind that I might change
the course of the antiquated studies on which I
was wasting my time. On making inquiries
about a rational system of education to which
I could devote myself, and by which I might
eventually make a future career and earn a
competence, I found that an entrance examination
was going to take place in three months
for the newly established law college. The
Government wished to find trained officials for
the new courts, and qualified advocates for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>the bar. I determined to try my luck; and a
young officer from the military academy, who
was residing close to our <i>madrasseh</i>, gave me,
as a favour, some coaching for the examination
in geography and arithmetic, the two subjects
in which I was most backward. I passed the
examination fairly well, and joined the law
l institution.</p>

<p>As I said before, all the progress of the
educational institutions of modern creation
has of late been lamentably hampered by the
interference of the Sultan's palace Government,
whose principal desire is to crush the growing
liberalism. I should, however, mention here,
to the credit of the Porte, that these institutions
were originally founded, and have always
been maintained, at the expense of the State,
and that they are mostly free and open to
students of all classes of people, without distinction
of race or faith. In our first year's
class at the law college, in which there were
about forty-five students, the number of
Armenians alone reached thirteen.</p>

<p>By giving some account of the subjects
taught us in the law college of Constantinople,
I shall be able to state in brief the nature of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>the statutes and constitution of the Ottoman
empire and its judiciary institutions.</p>

<p>Besides a few subjects which are of general
interest to all trained lawyers and legal officers,
there are various courses of lectures on the
civil code and its procedure, criminal law and
its procedure, land law, commercial and mercantile
law, digest of administrative regulations,
chapters on international law and capitulation
treaties, and so forth. The civil code is based
upon the rules established in succeeding
centuries from the time of the Ommiade and
Abbaside Caliphates down to the early days of
the Ottomans, as set down by various Arabic
books, which were compiled by the early
Moslem jurists, who have made many commentaries
on them. The civil code of Turkey,
therefore, is based entirely upon the ordinances
of the Mussulman secular law. It was framed
by a board of men well versed in the literature
and the jurisprudence of the Moslem East.
This board was formed during the reign of the
late Sultan, and it took nearly fifteen years to
carry out the necessary researches and frame
the code as it now exists. It is noteworthy
that, as has been shown by competent author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>ities,
there are many essential points of resemblance
between this code and the civil laws
of some European nations which have borrowed
their materials from the sources of Roman law.
The procedure of the Turkish civil code is
based partly on the French system and partly
on the usages which existed in the ancient
courts of Turkey. The land law is also based
on the principles of the Mussulman secular
law relating to land and estates, and on the
established precedents existing in the empire.
This law is of much interest to Europeans
residing in Turkey, because while, so far as
the criminal and civil cases are concerned,
those Europeans enjoy the protection of their
capitulation privileges, with regard to the land
law they are subject to the complete jurisdiction
of the Ottoman Government. The reason of
this is that when the representatives of the
Great Powers demanded that the Porte should
grant to their subjects the right of acquiring property
in the Ottoman dominions, the Porte insisted
that, as a counter-concession, the Powers
should renounce the capitulation privileges, and
thus leave their subjects under the jurisdiction
of Turkey, so far as the acquisition of land and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>cases arising from it were concerned. The
criminal law and its procedure, the procedure
concerning the formation of courts, and commercial
law are almost entirely copied from the
French judicial system, while the mercantile
law is copied partly from France and partly
from Holland. Most regulations of various
kinds promulgated since the Treaty of Paris
have been adopted from the State regulations
of some of the Continental Powers, more
especially of France. In many cases they have
been adopted without much regard to the
local requirements of the Levant. The pressure
put upon the Porte by the Great Powers
at different periods for the introduction of
reforms is responsible for the hasty adoption
of the least suitable of these legal and administrative
laws.</p>

<p>The details I have given above will give
some idea of the existing statutes and constitution
of the Ottoman Empire. When you
open your best books of reference to see what
are the laws of Turkey, you will find in one this
useful piece of information:&mdash;"The Koran is
the legal and theological code upon which the
fundamental laws of the Empire are based,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>while in another you will see the following
illuminating passage:&mdash;".... Fundamental
laws of the Empire are based upon the precepts
of the Koran. The next to Koran the laws of
Multeka" (!) I have no doubt this last bit of
knowledge is borrowed from the meaningless
writings of Canon McColl on Turkish matters.
I have often pointed out to Englishmen of my
acquaintance many of the mistaken notions
prevailing in this country on the affairs of the
nearer East. The answers and reasons given
to me were always the same&mdash;namely, that
Englishmen are not much interested in Turkish
matters nowadays. This indifference on the
part of Englishmen is the chief reason why the
prestige of Great Britain is doomed to disappear
in the Levant. If the editors or writers
of such productions as those I have quoted are
also of the opinion that Englishmen do not
now take an interest in the Turkish empire, I
should think that, instead of filling up their
pages with ridiculous inaccuracies, they would
be better advised not to write anything on
Turkey at all.</p>

<p>As regards the law courts of Turkey, they
can be divided into two main classes-the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>courts and the reformed courts. The old courts
form part of the office of the Sheikh-ul-Islam,
and they have a half-religious complexion.
Their functions are nowadays reduced to a few
matters, such as the settling of inheritance, deciding
on divorce actions, certifying marriages,
and looking after such other cases as may
arise among the members of a Mohammedan
community. Questions of this nature among
the native Christian communities are taken
charge of by the Patriarchate of each community.</p>

<p>With the exception of the courts which are
charged with the trial of all civil officials who
may be accused of offences connected solely
with their administrative duties, and which are
attached to the Council of State Presidency, all
the reformed courts form part of the Ministry of
Justice. Like all the departmental bureaus of
that Ministry, the central courts are situated in
the huge buildings opposite St. Sophia, and just
outside the gate of the ancient seraglio. Both
criminal and ordinary civil courts are divided
into three degrees&mdash;namely, preliminary, appeal,
and cassation courts. Here there are also two
commercial courts, one dealing with cases
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>connected with the mercantile marine, the other
with actions arising out of all commercial and
trading matters. A section of the latter court
has a mixed or international character; that is
to say, among its members there are foreigners,
not appointed by the Ottoman Government, but
deputed by foreigners. This section deals with
the commercial disputes between Ottoman and
foreign subjects.</p>

<p>The old semi-ecclesiastical courts, from the
time when they had to deal with every kind of
lawsuit until now, have been conducted on what
I may call a 'one-judge system,' that is to say,
each court, like the English law courts, has a
single judge to deal with the cases brought
before it But each of the new or reformed
courts has, besides the chief judge, several
deputy judges; in other words, a president and
members. This imitation of the legal arrangements
of France has not proved the check on
the perversions of justice charged against the
old simple method which was expected.
Experience has shown that as the population
of Turkey is so widely heterogeneous,
to have several judges in a court, who may
belong to different nationalities and religions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>gives rise to even more corruption and partiality
than when there is one only.</p>

<p>The evils of the present Hamidian tyranny
have destroyed all the confidence of the people
in the new courts. Legal officers of capability
and integrity are either exiled or appointed to
courts in obscure corners of the empire, and
the central courts are filled with the favourites
of the Palace clique, and these creatures deal
out 'justice' according to the will of the
Palace. The Sultan has given them orders
recently to condemn all opponents of his misrule.
Lately about a hundred innocent men
have been condemned to death or penal
servitude, and their properties have been
confiscated by the central criminal courts on
the charge of 'high treason.'</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">****</span></p>

<p>Just about the time when I was preparing
for my final examination, the director of my
college informed me that he had received a
communication from the War Office to the effect
that I was among the list of men for the year's
conscription. This was a very disturbing piece
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>of news to me, as I had just decided to adopt a
new profession, and had left my <i>madrasseh</i>.
The students in <i>madrassehs</i>, who have passed
an examination in Arabic and other subjects
taught them in that language, are exempted
from serving in the army. Although our
college was one of the educational institutions
of the State, the students of which are also
exempted under certain conditions from military
service, this exemption had only been recently
granted, and the military authorities did not
know much about it. Those who knew of it
did not view it with favour, as they are very
anxious to force rigid conscription upon everyone.
They will not argue on this point, and
will dispose of all arguments with military
brusqueness. It took several months to get the
military authorities at the Constantinople War
Office and the officers of the division at my
birthplace in Anatolia to exempt me from
serving in the army, and my dispute with
them interfered very seriously with my last
and most difficult examination in the college,
and as a result I had to content myself with
a second-class diploma only. It was not
because I was afraid of a soldier's life that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>wanted to escape it; cowardice is not one of an
Osmanli's failings. Indeed, when I first came
to Constantinople my wish had been to go to
a military school to be trained as an officer, but
my uncle ignored it and sent me to the theological
<i>madrasseh</i>. Now, after several years, to
be sent compulsorily into the army as a private
would have ruined all my chances in the new
career I had mapped out for myself, and there
is but little chance of promotion from the
ranks.</p>

<span class="center">OFFICERS OF LANCERS.</span></a></div>

<p>The methods of conscription in Turkey
differ from those of other military countries.
Although military service is obligatory in the
Turkish empire, conscription is not universal;
that is to say, the privileged natives of Constantinople,
the inhabitants of all frontier
districts, such as the Albanians and Kurdish
clans and Arab tribes, are not forced to serve
in the army. Moreover, the Armenians,
Greeks, and non-Mussulman natives of the
country are completely exempted from military
service, and instead of serving as soldiers, each
male member of these peoples pays a yearly
exemption tax, the amount of which, if I am
not mistaken, is about five or six shillings.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>Many of these native Christians exercise an
incredible amount of ingenuity to get out of
paying the tax, and they all grumble incessantly
at its tremendous heaviness. They always
complain to their European sympathisers about
this, and as a matter of fact some kind British
politicians take this grievance of the 'oppressed
Christian' in hand every now and then, and
style it one of the numerous injustices committed
against them by the Turks, and defend
their cause vigorously in the press or on the
platform, in the name of humanity and Christianity.
Sometimes you will hear the native
Christians of Turkey complain that they are
not equally treated, because they are not
admitted into the army. But it is easy to see
that this half-hearted complaint is merely made
for the sake of grumbling, as they are only
too thankful for their exemption, knowing what
hardships, misery, and material losses are caused
by being away for years from home on active
service, and they are not unaware that a community
liable to stringent conscription is likely
to have its numbers thinned. I am not one
of those so-called enlightened people styled
'advanced' Turks, who advocate the admission
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>of these Eastern Christians into the Turkish
army. I may be called a fanatic; but so
far as the interests of my nation are concerned,
I do not mind being so called. What
would become of the loyalty, supreme obedience
to command, self-sacrificing devotion, and undaunted
fighting capacity which distinguish
our army, if the Eastern Christians were
admitted into it?<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> The Turkish army has
always inspired fear in the ambitious and
aspiring enemies of our territories, and if it
were not for the Turkish army the remainder
of the empire would have been divided up long
ago. It has beaten a nation which had eighty
thousand trained men in the field, and which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
received moral and material support from all
parts of Europe, in a month. It has made, by
its heroic action in the field, an astonished
German veteran jump up and exclaim enthusiastically&mdash;"What
a brilliant army!" and a
well known English war correspondent say&mdash;"If
Alexander came out of his grave he would
conquer the world with the Turkish army."
This army performed so brilliant a feat as the
defence of Plevna; fought, without allies, the
greatest conquering nation of our time for
nearly a year; and if it were not for the most
calamitous mismanagement of the present Sultan,
it could probably have pushed back the Russian
invaders across the Danube twenty-five years
ago. The apprehension of what would happen
if Greeks, Armenians, and non-Moslem Syrians
were admitted into the army is also justified by
the fact that they could not be trusted in the
event of a great struggle with, say, Russia. Of
course, the Russian army has in it a large
number of Mussulman soldiers, and these men
fought desperately against us during the last
Russo-Turkish War. But while Russia would
punish severely any treason committed by them,
Turkey could not punish these Eastern Chris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>tians
for the same offence. Europe would call
that punishment persecution, and at once interfere
on their behalf. We know the true feelings
of these people well, and whatever concession
is granted them, it is impossible to inspire in
them any feeling of patriotism for the Ottoman
empire in general. Those who advocate their
inclusion in the army, moreover, say that it
would increase the numerical strength of our
fighting forces. But the Ottoman army would
exceed a million men nowadays in the case of
necessity, and for purposes of defence this would
be fully a match for any enemy. Another
plea for the admission of Christian subjects of
Turkey into the army is that, as they are free
from conscription, their men stay at home, work
without hindrance, and look after the prosperity
and welfare of their families uninterruptedly,
and their number is on the increase as a consequence.
It is quite true that compulsory
military service is telling upon the Turkish
nation alarmingly. A man is liable to fight
from his twentieth year to his fortieth whenever
he may be called upon to do so, and he is,
of course, always liable to be killed. When he
is called to arms, his business is paralysed and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>his poor family left without assistance. But
these difficulties can be remedied if the general
maladministration is improved, and I hope it
will be improved as soon as the present regime
is changed.</p>

<p>In the preceding chapter I gave a summarised
account of the jurisdiction of Turkey, and also
made an allusion to the admission of the
Armenians and other non-Mussulman natives
of Turkey to the judicial institutions. Here I
will say something on the position held by
foreign subjects in regard to the law of the
country, as well as on the disposition of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>non-Mussulman population towards the Ottoman
empire.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, foreigners enjoy a most
extraordinarily privileged position in Turkey,
and their privileges are known as 'capitulations.'</p>

<p>Every foreign colony forms a distinct
<i>imperium in imperio</i> more markedly in Constantinople
than in any other city of the Ottoman
empire. Every individual foreigner enjoys
extra-territorial privileges, such as in other
countries could only be afforded to the diplomatic
representatives of Foreign Powers.
Whatever crime a foreign subject may commit,
he is not amenable to the authority of the
Ottoman Government The capitulation
privileges of the foreign subjects granted in
bygone centuries by the Ottoman rulers to
European visitors, who were then few in
number, were in reality acts of hospitality.
But they have been abused in later times by
those in whose favour they were granted. I
cannot here enter into the details of the capitulation
privileges which<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> fetter the hands of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>the Ottoman statesman, which create insurmountable
difficulties for the thorough enforcement
of the laws, and which seriously impede
the adoption of progress and reforms. There
was at one time a real possibility of the Porte
getting rid, at least partially, of these capitulation
privileges, which are really not justified
by international law, and some friendly Powers,
notably Great Britain, appeared well disposed
to discuss the advisability of making some
modification in them. In fact, certain concessions
were made to the Porte in the carrying
out of the sentences passed by it on foreign
criminals. These modifications could still be
successfully brought about if Turkey could
earnestly set to work to reorganise the administration
of the country, and to introduce such
practical reforms as are necessitated by the
actual requirements of the case, and then
appeal to the justice and equity of the Great
Powers not to insist upon exercising fully the
capitulation privileges of their subjects. It
was some thirty years ago that the statesmen
of the Sublime Porte seriously meant to ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>complish
this great task. But with the beginning
of Abd-ul-Hamid's disastrous reign all
the previous schemes of the Porte were brought
to naught This capricious Sultan began to
rule over an important empire, which required
the most delicate handling, in a manner which
has never before been seen in the history of
any civilised or semi-civilised State, and which
can only be paralleled by the mode of governing
of some wild tribal chieftain. He proceeded,
with a tyrant's zest, to crush the influence of
Ottoman statesmen of capability and integrity,
and handed over the most important offices of
the State to ignorant fanatics and to cosmopolitan
upstarts, whose one claim to notice was their
dishonourable behaviour. One of the results
of the present rule has been that foreign
residents in Turkey have naturally clung more
firmly to their extra-territorial privileges, and
the old capitulation privileges have given rise
to new privileges which are by no means based
upon the stipulations of the ancient treaties.
So one can now see in Constantinople the most
amazing anomaly of many centres of Government,
all distinct from one another, and all of
them utterly unaffected by the sovereignty of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>the Porte. Thus the independence of Turkey
is quite fictitious nowadays, and Abd-ul-Hamid
can only satisfy his lust of tyranny by oppressing
the section of his subjects who can expect no
outside protection or sympathy.</p>

<p>Throughout these pages I have consistently
condemned the misrule of the present Sultan.
My feeling against his ways is the stronger
because I am sure that, in spite of the ascendancy
gained by foreigners in Turkey, she might
yet assert and maintain an honest and sound
administration, in place of the miserable tyranny
which oppresses her now. But as it is, the
Foreign Powers, taking advantage of the existing
misrule, not only fetter the hands of Turkish
statesmen by persistently demanding fresh
extra-territorial privileges for their subjects,
but also take up, some of them, the cause of
those Eastern Christians who are under Ottoman
rule, alleging that they are acting in the
name of 'humanity.'</p>

<p>Their real motive, however, is that they may
use them as a <i>point d'appui</i> for their political
schemes and designs. Thus these subject
populations of Turkey, whose true racial
characteristics have often been made clear by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>Englishmen who have travelled in the Levant,
form a great internal danger to the integrity of
the Ottoman empire. The subject populations
of Turkey are of course of various distinct
nationalities, such as Greeks, Armenians, Bulgarians,
non-Mohammedan Syrians, and so
forth. Each of these large communities has
its own quarter, churches and denominational
schools, national aspirations and separatist
ideas. Each community speaks its own
language, each native Christian community
entertains, nowadays more or less without disguise,
sentiments of animosity towards the
Osmanlis, and even sympathises with the
enemies of the Turkish empire in time of international
trouble or war. These sentiments
of the Eastern Christians are known to many
politicians in this country, and they excuse these
treasonable sentiments of their 'Christian
brethren' by maintaining that they are the
natural outcome of long years of oppression
and persecution. This apologetic contention is
not based upon an intimate knowledge of the
real state of things in the nearer East, nor is it
at all justifiable. Of course, the Ottoman
empire has long been suffering from intolerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>oppression, but its Christian inhabitants have
not been the only sufferers; on the other hand,
many of them have allowed themselves to be
the cause of oppression, and have even acted as
the right-hand men of the oppressors. If there
had ever been a serious persecution particularly
directed against the native Christians, there
would not now be many Armenians or Greeks
left alive in Turkey. In past ages they were
entirely at the mercy of the Ottomans; there
was no European Power, and no Concert of
Powers, strong enough to stop the conversion
or extermination of the non-Mussulman population
of the Ottoman empire. There could be
no better proof of the tolerant policy of the
Osmanlis towards their subject populations than
the actual existence at the present day in that
country of so many millions of native Christians
of all denominations. Moreover, not only have
native Christians had their existence assured to
them, but also their freedom of conscience,
which is amply proved by the fact that their
ecclesiastical constitutions, their languages, and
their national customs have been respected
by the Turks. But this liberal treatment
has been abused by the subject populations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>of Turkey. They have never done anything to
show their gratitude, and have never displayed
any patriotism towards the Ottoman empire.
If they were to do so it might perhaps save
Turkey from internal dissensions, and from
consequent strife, anarchy, and the ruin which
stares it in the face. The history of Turkey
must have taught the Russians wisdom, for they
are careful to insist upon the Russification of
their conquered subject populations, and never
risk grafting on to their stem a shoot which
may turn out to have thorns. The fact is that
tolerance towards subject populations of alien
race and faith, as shown by Mussulmans,
excellent as it may appear to sentimental
humanitarians, is a sure way of imperilling the
future independence of a nation.</p>

<p>Of all her non-Mussulman subjects Turkey
has the greatest reason to be anxious about the
Armenians and their separatist movement.
The ambition of Armenian agitators is to form
an independent State in an important portion of
Asia Minor, the backbone of the Ottoman
empire. I therefore wish to make a few remarks
here on Armenian matters, in particular
as, though Armenian affairs may seem to be in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>the background at present, political mischief makers
will take up this plaything of theirs
again sooner or later.</p>

<p>As I pointed out in the last chapter, among
forty-five students of the faculty of law, thirteen
were Armenians. Thirteen out of forty-five is
proportionately a large number, considering the
small number of Armenians relatively to other
nationalities of the Ottoman empire. The
Armenians are admittedly very industrious
people. They won good marks in the entrance
examination, and the authorities at the Ministry
of Public Instruction would not affix a limit of
number, but admitted as many as successfully
passed the examination. I doubt, however,
after those agitations, if such impartiality has
been shown towards the members of that race
in all Ottoman institutions. And if not it
would not be a matter for surprise when one
considers how the Armenians have conducted
themselves towards the Empire and their
Mussulman compatriots for some time past.</p>

<p>Yes, people in this country heard much about
the massacres. Doubtless they were abominable,
and doubtless many innocent persons were
slaughtered. But it is only common justice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>that one should try to find out what were the
reasons for attacking Armenians before one
judges and condemns those who did so. It
is a fact that there was never such an outburst
of enmity to the Armenians before; if
there had been, there would not be over two
millions living in the Ottoman empire now.
The Armenians are an adventurous race;
they can go anywhere, settle anywhere, and
become subject to any State. Some years
before the troubles, many of the foreign subject
Armenians came over to Turkey, styling themselves
Frenchmen, Englishmen and Americans,
sometimes in the shape of missionaries, sometimes
as teachers. These adventurers, together
with the revolutionary Russian subject
Armenians, who came mostly from the Caucasus,
began to stir up the people of their own race
all over Asiatic Turkey in favour of a national
independence. The younger generation of the
Armenian people, becoming intoxicated with
great ideas and dreams of a national kingdom,
overlooked the impossibility of establishing any
such thing in any particular part of the Ottoman
dominions, and did not realise that their people
formed a miserable minority everywhere. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>has been maintained by their political sympathisers
in England that their agitations were
for the purpose of being better governed, and
in no way a separatist movement; but this is
absurd, and was merely an after-thought. As a
matter of fact the Armenians gave loud expression
to their new aspirations of having an
independent kingdom in Eastern Asia Minor.
We heard everywhere from them that the
Christian Powers&mdash;above all, Great Britain were
going to hand over that portion of the 'decaying'
Ottoman empire to them, as they had
handed over Ottoman territories before to other
Christian races of the East They were simply
awaiting the prophesied moment of the partition
of Turkey to establish their independence on
their share of the divided territory. I myself
heard Armenians talking about who were to be
the future rulers among their own people. The
Turks began to ask themselves such questions
as, "Why do these people revolt against us
when we suffer from misrule much more than
they do, and when, moreover, the official misdeeds
are partly due to Armenian jacks-in-office?"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
The agitation among the Ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>menians
grew worse and worse every day; the
agitators resorted to the same old method,
namely, they tried to provoke the Turkish
populace to retaliate on its offenders, hoping
that this would be represented in Europe as
an outburst of Mussulman fanaticism, and
would induce the Powers to intervene, and
so hasten the partition. The Turks, or, more
widely speaking, the Mussulman population
of Asiatic Turkey, were gravely discussing
what could be done to check this overbearing
and mischievous behaviour. Turkish women
and children were exposed to ill-treatment and
insult throughout Asia Minor. The Turk's
patience is almost inexhaustible, but when you
attack his women and children his anger is
roused, and nothing on earth can control it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>and he saw that the Government of the Sultan
was utterly powerless to punish the Armenian
agitators and revolutionists of foreign nationality.
Did the humanitarian British public know these
things? No; it does not care to know anything
which might be favourable to the Turks.
Have the political journals of this country
mentioned the facts. I have stated? Of course
not, because&mdash;to speak plainly&mdash;they knew that
in the Armenian pie there were the fingers of
some of their own politicians. Shortly before
the massacres, I heard many Turkish people,
who had lived side by side with the Armenians
for centuries, saying that it was a mistake to be
angry with the Kurds for their treatment of the
Armenians in Eastern Asia Minor, and that
it was the right thing to crush these people.
Then there came the dark days of those terrible
massacres. The Armenian revolutionists, who
ultimately managed to go abroad scot-free, gave
great provocation by throwing dynamite bombs
in many places and killing women and children
of the Mussulman population. These people
could no longer expect that the Government of
the Sultan would do anything to settle the
agitation and prevent further mischief, so at last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>they took the law into their own hands and put
down the Armenian movement in the manner
we all know. The Sultan, who was eating his
heart out at his inability to punish the revolutionary
Armenians of foreign extraction, simply
connived at the doings of the enraged populace,
if he did not actually instigate and encourage
them; but, unfortunately, by his connivance, it
was mostly innocent Armenians who perished
at the hands of the mob, and only a very few
of the guilty ringleaders suffered.</p>

<p>Although the Armenians are hard-working
and energetic, they will never recover their
former prosperity.</p>

<p>They have always had every opportunity
of enriching themselves. They had a firm
footing and influential positions in the royal
establishments, which made them practically
the trustees and paymasters of the revenues of
the empire. Their opportunities began with
the foundation of the Ottoman power in Asia
Minor, which found them a scattered remnant
of a race, with their political existence already
stamped out by other conquerors, and which,
though it did not restore their freedom politically,
at least assured to them the advantages
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>of individual prosperity, protection and toleration.
As an instance of what the Turks have
been willing to do for the Armenians, I may
quote the religious difficulties early in the last
century. It was at the beginning of the
missionary movement in Europe, and both
Protestant and Catholic missionaries poured
into Turkey and set about proselytising the
Armenians, with more zeal than discretion.
The Armenian Patriarch appealed to the
Turkish Government to expel these foreign
missionaries who were causing trouble in his
community, and in response to his appeal the
Government at once put great restrictions upon
the missionaries, and this in spite of the fact
that by so doing it ran the risk of incurring
European enmity. In mentioning this I do
not say anything against mission work; I
merely instance the circumstance to show the
tolerance with which the Turks have always
treated the Armenians and their religion, and
how untrue is the accusation brought against
them of systematic religious persecution.</p>

<p>However, I doubt if the Mussulman population
will ever place the same confidence in the
Armenians again. We do not see now so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>many of those flourishing Armenian Pashas
in the high Government offices of Turkey as
we did before, though they are regaining some
of their old hold in Government circles. As
a natural result of being out of favour, the race
will not probably find it so easy a matter to
gain admission to the educational institutions
of the State.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br /><br />

<small>A NEW COSTUME AND A NEW CAREER.</small><br /><br /></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>I adopt European dress&mdash;The standard of civilisation&mdash;English
clothes 'made in Austria'&mdash;European dress
first adopted under Sultan Mahmud&mdash;My vain attempts
to get an appointment&mdash;Requisite qualifications for
Government employment, bribery and espionage&mdash;The
only livelihood possible for educated men&mdash;I become
a lawyer&mdash;I penetrate high official quarters.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I had passed the final examination in
the law college I began to attend the Courts to
see and learn the actual working of the forms
of the procedures. I now grew to dislike having
to go to the Courts and Government offices in
the <i>Ulema</i> costume, which I still wore. In
fact, even in my class at the college there
were only a few persons belonging to <i>madrassehs</i>,
and they alone were attired in the
semi-religious dress, and the contrast between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>our appearance and the rest in the class, who
were attired in ordinary civilian dress, seemed
to us to make us look old-fashioned. So, like
most of my countrymen, I was seized with
the ambition of appearing up-to-date, and of
dressing in the more modern manner; that is
to say, European costume in all but the fez.
Before I could do this, however, and become,
so to speak, an ordinary layman, I had to leave
the life of the <i>madrasseh</i> altogether, for the
people in those ancient institutions regard the
discarding of the academical turban and long
cloak, and the adoption of European clothes,
as a renunciation of the profession. Anyone
who ventures to do this forfeits his right
to a lodging in the <i>madrasseh</i>. I did not
know where to go after leaving my <i>madrasseh</i>,
as Turkish families cannot take any stranger
into their houses as a boarder, while to go
into a Greek or Armenian family would not
do for a young Mussulman, for many reasons.
So I hired two rooms in an inn, which was as
filthy as these inns always are. I went to the
European quarter of Constantinople and bought
a suit of clothes from one of the numerous
clothiers, who are mostly Austrian Jews, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>who bring the clothes ready-made from Austria.
Their goods are ridiculously cheap, but the
tailoring and the material are extremely bad.
It is a proverb in Constantinople that when you
buy a suit of clothes from these Austrian shops
and put it on, it will be worn out before you
can cross over the Golden Horn Bridge back
to Stamboul. Curiously enough, some of these
Austrians try to pass their goods off as of
English manufacture, as the English-made
goods have a better reputation than the
Austrian even in Turkey.</p>

<p>But, bad though they were, I was well content
with my new clothes, as this was a step forward
in satisfaction of my craze to dress as the
Europeans did. It is a fact that most people
who adopt this form of dress in the nearer East
look upon those who have not adopted it, or do
not desire to adopt it, as incapable of acquiring
'civilised' habits. Snobbish as it is, no doubt,
this idea is not without reason. A few years
ago, when there was an anti-Turkish agitation
in England, I observed in some of the
Radical papers remarks to the effect that, while
the Eastern Christians who had been liberated
from the Turkish yoke had adopted civilised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>methods, the Turks themselves seemed to be
incapable of progress or civilisation. In reality,
these 'Europeanised' Eastern Christians are
no more civilised than the turbaned villagers
of Asia Minor; their imitation of civilised
methods and habits is merely superficial; but
they manage to make themselves look like
Europeans; and the world passes its judgment
on most matters by surface evidence. Not
long ago I saw an article in the Spectator,
dealing with the incapacity of dark races
to adopt civilised manners, and, as one of
the examples, it was cited that the late
Midhat Pasha used to hate some aspects of
European costume, especially evening dress.
It was a revelation to me that Midhat and
his nation were included in the category of
the dark races, and it was also a surprise
to me that the Spectator did not remember
that many Englishmen of perfectly civilised
habits and high culture hate some of the
grotesque forms of European costume. It
was, however, this sort of feeling among the
majority of Europeans that made us wish to imitate
them, at least outwardly, so that we might
not be accused of being unfitted for civilised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>ways. If the Turkish Government would make
the women of harems discard their 'barbarous'
veils, and go about like European women, and
urge all its subjects to put on European
costumes, and also hats instead of the fez or
turban, its action would doubtless be hailed
in many quarters as the real beginning of the
civilisation of Turkey.</p>

<p>Sultan Mahmud II., the exterminator of the
Janissaries, was the first man who perceived
this prejudiced feeling of Europe some eighty
years ago. He knew that the undying hostility
of the nations of Western Europe against his
empire was simply because Turkey was not a
Christian State.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> As he could not accept any
form of the religions of Christendom, he thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>he would lessen the old hostility of Europe which
must be lessened if Turkey in Europe
were to continue to exist&mdash;by imitating, at least
outwardly, the other peoples of Europe. So
he ordered all the officials of the State to adopt
European attire, and himself was the first to
give up the old head-dress or turban and the
long robe, and to replace them by a modified
kind of European uniform. The most conservative
and religious section of the Turks raised
a howl of protest against this measure, but they
could not support their case by any valid
canonical law. The tradition that "He who
makes himself look like the infidels is one of
them," which is attributed to the Prophet, was
proved to be spurious. But, in spite of his
innovations, Sultan Mahmud II. could not
adopt the European hat, as his fanatical
opponents discovered that the Prophet explicitly
prohibited his followers from wearing
the head-dress of unbelievers, which was
at that time three-cornered in shape, the
comers signifying the belief in the 'Trinity,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>a belief which is repudiated by Unitarian
Mohammedanism. The objectors, moreover,
maintained that a man could not put his
forehead on the ground in prostration during
worship with any form of European hat. So
the Sultan, instead of taking the European
head-dress as well, adopted the fez, which was
worn mostly by the Greeks of the Mediterranean
Archipelago.</p>

<p>I do not say that Mahmud II. did unwisely
in discarding his forefathers' turbaned crown
and long, furred robe. But it was a great pity
that he did not retain the ancient national
costumes for special ceremonial occasions at
least, if only for antiquarian interest. In looking
at pictures and drawings illustrating the
olden days, one cannot help admiring those
gorgeous old Turkish dresses. Persons of
every class and profession had their big turban
of a particular shape, their long robe, wide
trousers, and so forth, and in these costumes
looked not only picturesque, but also imposing
and dignified. Ever since the first change,
people in Turkey have been adopting the
European style of costume, and those who
now retain the old attire are only the humbler
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>class of people in the provinces, tradesmen,
peasants, and the class of the <i>Ulema</i>.</p>

<p>Following my example, four other men
among the students of the law college who
came from <i>madrassehs</i> also changed their
costume. Of course, they had also to leave
their <i>madrassehs</i> on account of their conduct.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="gesperrt">****</span></p>

<p>After I had secured my exemption from
military service, and had got over the protracted
final examination in the law college, I found
that my real troubles in life were only just
beginning, for the problem of making a position
for myself lay before me. I was now
entirely dependent upon my own labours to
earn my bread. As I mentioned at the
beginning of the book, we had no longer any
hope of recovering our confiscated lands, and
the little instalments advanced to me periodically
out of the revenue of those lands during
our lawsuit with the authorities, which lasted
fifteen years, were now very irregularly paid.
In fact, I was becoming thoroughly disgusted
by the fact that we had to make the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>humble entreaties to the arrogant officials of
the Sultan in order to persuade them to advance
the small sums they owed to us. I wished to
obtain some appointment, either in the Courts
or the Ministry of Justice, but there seemed
little chance of my doing so. As I have
been endeavouring to show throughout these
chapters, the administration in the reign of
Abd-ul-Hamid has been the most corrupt that
our unfortunate country has ever known. No
one, however highly qualified he may be, can
get any employment in any Government
department unless he is connected with some
highly-placed creature of the Sultan, or unless
he is able to bribe high officials, or is cunning
enough to concoct some grave political charge
against others and denounce them to the tyrant
at Yildiz Kiosk. Those who do this last
service are known as 'Palace spies.' I had
no relation in the Sultan's palace who might
have obtained a Government appointment for
me; and had, of course, no money to lay out
in bribery, and so purchase an appointment,
while the trade of a spy was entirely repugnant
to my feelings. I may be asked why, instead
of striving to get official employment, I did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>try to find other work. The fact is that
official employment is nowadays the only way
in Turkey in which persons of any education
can earn a livelihood. In order to explain
this I must give some account of the nature
of officialdom under the Sultan's bureaucracy.</p>

<p>As the Sultan has never relaxed his determination
to crush the power and the influence
of the well-to-do families, an independent
existence has now been made impossible for
them. Therefore everyone of birth and
education must depend upon a Government
salary for his maintenance, and so be at the
mercy of the Sultan, who has gradually and
systematically obtained control of all the
financial resources of Turkey. Strictly speaking,
there is no such thing in Turkey as a
distinct aristocracy. High titled officials of
the State may impress foreign observers as
being members of an aristocracy, but in reality
those officials can be raised even from people
of the lowest station in life. There have
always been, nevertheless, good old families in
the provinces, who, though they received the
appreciation and respect of the masses, had no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>pretensions to any actual superiority over their
dependants. The governing factions, who
were appointed and promoted by the central
Government, were quite distinct from either
the rich or the poor populations of most Turkish
provinces. This state of society existed up to
the beginning of the present reign. When
Abd-ul-Hamid began to establish his personal
rule, and founded the present bureaucracy, he
saw a danger in the independent manner of
life of the old families, and in their democratic
and friendly relations with the poorer
classes.</p>

<p>At first he tried to demoralise those ancient
families by conferring upon them official titles
and decorations, hoping thus to impress them
with an idea of rank, which would bring
attendant jealousies, and make them strive
hard to gain higher rank and decorations than
the rest of their fellows. Besides this, the
Sultan acquired large tracts of land in the
fertile districts throughout the empire, and, as
a step in his policy of wholesale acquisition, the
lands and properties of the local magnates were
gradually taken possession of on some pretext
or other by the administrators of the Civil List.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>Thus it was that those who had once been independent
landowners received official titles,
and became part and parcel of the Palace
official world. They now depend almost entirely
for their living upon salaries paid out
of the public treasury, which treasury is supplied
for the most part by taxes extorted
from the poorer provincials and peasant proprietors.</p>

<p>At present there are only two ways in which
Turkish subjects can obtain a livelihood.
Either they must be content to pocket their
pride, and labour as workmen, small tradesmen,
ordinary craftsmen, farm labourers, and so
forth, or else they must somehow get a Government
appointment A man of education must
make a Government salary his ambition in life,
and must direct all his energies to increasing it.
It therefore follows that the number of unnecessary
officials in Turkey is enormous,
and consequently their salaries are small, and
also constantly in arrears. Even the payment
of a salary due to an official is a matter for an
appeal to the Sultan's benevolence; any
increase is naturally even more so. Only
those who are able to show loyalty to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>person of the Sultan get their salaries increased
and their arrears paid. The best form
of showing the required loyalty for an official
is, as before stated, to spy upon others, and
denounce them as intriguing against his
sovereignty. Those who cannot or will not
show their loyalty in this way are soon reduced
to the point of starvation, if not exiled or
imprisoned, or condemned to death. There
is no other means of earning money for a
Turk of education in his own country nowadays.
No one can venture to carry on any
commerce or any legitimate money-making
enterprise independently, nor can he establish
any business relations with the outside world.
He would be instantly harassed by the lying
and intriguing Palace spies, and denounced to
the Sultan as carrying on some treasonable
negotiations, under the guise of doing business.
All kinds of industrial, commercial, and financial
combinations are most stringently forbidden
to Turks. Even two men cannot make an
association for any innocent and reasonable
business purpose, as such a proceeding would
doubtless be reported as the promotion of a
conspiracy. If a man is accused of doing such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>a thing, he has no chance of proving his
innocence. The spies have a perfectly free
hand, and nothing they may report is censured,
however monstrous or improbable it may be;
in fact, the more extraordinary and unlikely it
is, the more the spy who brings it will be
rewarded for his zeal.</p>

<p>There was therefore no way in which I could
obtain official employment But my diploma
from the law college qualified me to practise
as a barrister, so to that profession I determined
to devote my energies, although even in this
liberal profession no independence is possible,
on account of its being under the complete
control of officialdom.</p>

<p>Among my fellow law students who received
their diploma at the same time as myself only
a few contemplated practising at the Bar;
the remainder sought Government employment
Those who wished to earn their living as
lawyers had not the necessary private means
for starting in that profession. I was, however,
more fortunate than most. At this period of
my career, when I enjoyed much leisure, I used
to attend at the office of a well known Turkish
publisher and littérateur, who has now been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>exiled to Konia, in Asiatic Turkey, whose
office was called 'Imprimérie Ebuzzia,' after
his own name. There I read and corrected
proofs and contributed to his magazine. This
was, of course, before the Sultan's great literary
persecution, which resulted in the closing of
several printing offices, the suppression of
several journals, the burning of many books,
and the banishment of many persons connected
with the literary world. In this office I made
the acquaintance of a European, who was an
old resident in Constantinople, and was acting
as correspondent to the <i>Times</i>. This gentleman
and his European friends, who had some
business in the matter of concessions to settle
with the Turkish Government, occasionally
entrusted me with the drawing up of their
Turkish documents, and with interviewing
officials on their behalf. The documentary
work I received from them enabled me from
time to time to have access not only to several
high officials appointed by the Palace, but also
to the Imperial Palace itself. I thus had many
opportunities of observing closely the way in
which the ruling clique in Constantinople
performs its duties. I will now give some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>description of the real centre of authority in
the Turkish empire, which, I fancy, has never
been properly understood even by those
English politicians who are interested in the
eternal Eastern Question.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br /><br />

<small>THE SUBLIME PORTE AND YILDIZ KIOSK.</small><br /><br /></h2>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> the reign of the present Sultan the
centre of the ruling power in Turkey was the
'Sublime Porte' but since his accession, Yildiz
Kiosk (his palace) has absorbed every scrap of
authority in the country. Although, in diplomatic
and journalistic language, the 'Porte' or
'Sublime Porte,' is still used as the name for
the Government of Turkey, it can no longer
be regarded as a correct one. Before describing
Yildiz Kiosk, I should like to state what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>the 'Sublime Porte' means and represents.
'Sublime Porte' is the French translation of
the Turkish term '<i>Babi Aali</i>.' <i>Bab</i> means
'door,' and <i>Aali</i> 'superior.' Every Government
seat is called the 'door' in Turkey, for the
reason that the door of every office of the State
is supposed to be always open to any who may
wish to enter to seek justice and redress. The
most important of all Government offices (that
of the Grand Vizier and the three principal
Ministers, who are the President of the Councils
of State, the Foreign Minister, and the Minister
of the Interior, with their respective departmental
functionaries) is known as 'Sublime
Porte'; whereas the offices of the other
Ministers, such as Justice, Finance, Public
Works, Public Instruction, War, etc., which are
situated in separate localities, being considered
comparatively less important, are only called
the 'Door.'</p>

<p>The Council of the Ministers holds its meetings
under the presidency of the Grand Vizier
at the 'Sublime Porte.' Theoretically, the
affairs of State are still superintended by the
Ministers, but in reality nowadays they simply
supervise such scraps of State business as may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>be handed over to them by the Palace. The
present Cabinet Ministers of Turkey are either
men whose principle and ability are not of the
sort to inspire respect, or else weak nonentities,
who are merely appointed to carry out without
question the wishes of the Palace. They are
all appointed and protected by some influential
courtier of the Sultan. It is an open secret
that beyond reading and talking over the papers
sent to them by the Palace, the Cabinet Ministers
dare not discuss or settle any matter affecting
the vital interests of the country on their own
account; and it is also a matter of common
knowledge that the conversation of the Ministers
in Council is chiefly about the weather and
other safe, unexciting topics. The favourite
conversational opening of the late Sheikh-ul-Islam
in the Council, as is well known in
Constantinople, was:-" Under the benevolent
auspices of his Imperial Majesty, our august
Master, the weather is fine to-day." None of the
Ministers venture to make a statement or give an
opinion on any political situation. Like their
subordinates, the Ministers are in honour bound
to spy on one another. In short, the Cabinet
Ministers are now mere ciphers of the Court.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>
<p>The 'Sublime Porte' was first recognised as
the centre of the ruling power of the Ottoman
empire when such statesmen were in power as
Resheed Pasha (who was Grand Vizier during
the Crimean campaign), Aali Pasha, Fuad
Pasha (who accompanied the late Sultan Aziz
when the latter visited this country), and Midhat
Pasha, who compelled the Sultan to sanction a
Representative Assembly, and who was afterwards
done to death in his exile in Taif near
Mecca. The reason why Abd-ul-Hamid preserved
the 'Sublime Porte,' although he has
deprived it of every vestige of authority, is that
he found the Ministers useful as scapegoats at
various periods of his reign, when he had to
face important political crises. The Sultan has
until quite recently succeeded in hoodwinking
even the representatives of the European
Powers, and making them believe that the
authority which had to settle International
disputes was the 'Sublime Porte.' Thus he
has avoided the possibility of personal responsibility
for his misrule being brought home to
him, and causing diplomatic pressure to bear
directly on himself. The buildings which
contain the offices of the 'Sublime Porte' are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>situated in the Stamboul quarter of Constantinople,
and are close to St Sophia</p>

<p>Having explained what the Sublime Porte
once was and now is, and having also pointed
out that it has ceased to be even in a figurative
sense the Ottoman Government, I will now
give an account of Yildiz Kiosk. Yildiz means
'star' in Turkish. The majestic hill which is
situated on the European side of the Bosphorus
near the Marmora end of the Strait is called
the Yildiz. The word 'Kiosk,' or, as it is spelt
in Turkish, 'Koshq,' means both castle and
cottage. I believe it was Sultan Abd-ul-Mejid
who built the castle on the summit of the hill
and called it 'Yildiz Koshq.' The story runs
that this castle was built as a residence for a
favourite lady of that Sultan, to whose presence
in the harem of the palace his wife and mother
objected. Gossip also relates that she was an
Armenian, and the present Sultan is said to be
her son. Although the physiognomy of Abd-ul-Hamid
is very similar to that of a typical
Armenian, and his personal characteristics are
more Armenian than Turkish, this story rests
on a very slight foundation.</p>

<p>Twenty-six years ago the present Sultan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>transferred the royal seat to the house at Yildiz,
which was then a mere cottage. Many reasons
were adduced for his changing his dwelling so
soon after his accession. The ostensible reason
was that the air on the lofty Yildiz hill was
much finer than that round the old palace,
which lay on the damp shores of the Bosphorus.
But the real reason was that Yildiz was impregnable,
and that there his person would be
safely protected against any attempt to overthrow
him. During the last six-and-twenty
years he has never relaxed his efforts to make
his home at Yildiz safer and safer. The forest
extending from the top of the Yildiz hill down
to the shores of the Bosphorus is surrounded
with high and massive walls. I have never
had any opportunity of penetrating within the
forest It is said to be perpetually guarded by
numerous sentinels round the walls. Some
years ago a whole battalion of sappers worked
inside the forest of Yildiz Palace for months.
According to what I gathered from the reports
of the soldiers, the forest is mined in several
directions, and there must be a thorough workable
system of subterranean passages, for
what purpose it is not difficult to surmise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>I visited the outside of these walls at a time
when it was occasionally possible for strangers
to walk in the vicinity of the Yildiz Palace.
There are many blocks of barracks, thirty or
forty yards apart from one another, all along
the line of the wall In these barracks are
quartered troops of various nationalities&mdash;Arab,
Albanian, and Turkish. There is little friendliness
or intercourse between the men of the
different battalions; but all these simple-minded
privates of the guard have been so carefully
and systematically inspired with unhesitating
loyalty towards their 'father,' as they call the
Sultan, that they would quite willingly sacrifice
the last drop of their blood in the defence of
his precious life. Beyond these barracks there
are hills and valleys, which are also extensively
guarded by blockhouses and sentinels. Some
years ago, when the Turkish malcontents became
restless, a young officer in the Sultan's
guard drew a careful plan of the palace and its
defences, in which he showed its vulnerable
points. This plan was published some years
ago by the Turkish agitators in Geneva, with
the title "Instructions to be carried out in the
assault on Yildiz Palace." It is said that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>publication of this plan caused the Sultan to
alter all the defences of Yildiz.</p>

<p>The harem apartments and various small but
luxurious kiosks are situated in the interior of
the forest, which is said to be laid out in
beautiful flower-gardens, roads, lakes and canals.
There are several detached pavilions in the
palace gardens; one of the most splendid of
them is said to be the one in which the Sultan
entertains his princely foreign guests. The
Emperor of Germany lodged in it during his
two visits to Constantinople. The Sultan is
always eager to accommodate his royal visitors
within the establishment of Yildiz, so that he
may not be compelled to leave the palace
to call upon them. It is well known that he
takes the utmost care to make them comfortable
and to entertain them well. It is for
this reason that he has obtained the nickname
in certain discontented quarters of 'the
Charitable Hotel-keeper.' The Sultan always
enjoys his sport and takes his exercise in
his palace forest One of his means of recreation
is the Yildiz opera-house, in which
he, with his children or with his foreign
guests, patronises the drama, in which he takes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>a keen interest It is worthy of remark that,
while a strict censorship and a rigorous police
make the progress of dramatic art among his
subjects almost impossible, the Sultan's own
theatre is fitted with all the latest improvements.</p>

<p>The buildings in which the officials and
officers of the court, and the army of household
attendants (as we may call them) live, are
situated at the highest part of the Yildiz forest,
while at the opposite end, at the foot of the
forest, almost on the shore, is the Tcharagan
Palace, where ex-Sultan Murad, Abd-ul-Hamid's
mysterious and strictly-guarded captive,
is confined. No human being who is not
attached to the guard of the captive can
approach the latter palace. The bureaus of
the officials and officers on the top of the hill
are built just outside the walled garden. The
passage between the official residences and
offices and the Sultan's own quarters in the interior
is called the 'Mabeyn,' an Arabic word,
which means a space between two objects.
It is for that reason that the seraglio of the
Sultan is figuratively called the Mabeyn, so that
it may be distinguished from those of other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>princely palaces. In front of these departmental
offices there is another valley, which
was formerly inhabited chiefly by Turkish and
Armenian families. The houses of these
people have all been appropriated by the Civil
List, with the view of making the distance
between the palace at Yildiz and the people's
quarters as great as possible. Beyond this
valley there is another high hill, which is
covered with the private houses of the court
dignitaries. The object of the Sultan in building
these houses for his officials on his own account
was that he might prevent the Europeans
of Pera from coming into possession of land in
the direction of Yildiz, and in this way extending
their quarters into the vicinity of the palace.</p>

<p>With a few exceptions, the courtiers and
principal secretaries of the Sultan receive any
business connected with any branch of State
affairs, and deal with it after submitting it to
him. For instance, there is a military council
in the palace consisting of highly-favoured staff
officers, who decide on all important military
matters, although there is still an over-staffed
War Ministry, which, by the established statute
of the Empire, has to look after the affairs of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>the army. In the palace a highly important
espionage and police bureau is maintained,
though the old Ministry of the Police, with its
numerous officials, is still in existence. In the
palace reside those advisers to the Sultan
whose business it is to attend to matters
connected with Mussulman affairs, and to see
that the Sultan's position as Caliph in the
Mohammedan world is maintained; yet the old
office of the Sheikh-ul-Islam, which theoretically
should be in charge of such religious matters, is
still in existence, with its many officials. There
is a political and translation department at
Yildiz, which is entrusted with the examination
of such of the contents of the political press and
political literature of Europe as may deal with
Turkish matters, and which makes suggestions
on diplomatic affairs, though these things are
supposed to be done by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs at the Sublime Porte. The postal and
telegraphic office of Yildiz Palace is the greatest
and busiest of all post-offices in Turkey. All
governors, commanders, agents, ambassadors
and emissaries communicate directly with the
palace through this post-office.</p>

<p>The men who compose the Sultan's immedi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>ate
circle, and who are ruling the country, are
of many nationalities; some of them are
Europeans. Anyone who knows the origin
of these people would not hesitate to agree
with me when I say that in the present reign
the power and rule of Turkey is not in the
hands of real Turks.</p>

<p>Hundreds of officials, officers, and retainers
actually live on the premises of the palace. On
one occasion I saw dinner being served out to
the household of the palace. Numerous servants
hurried about in all directions, carrying on
their heads large wooden trays full of dishes.
The number of the chefs and assistant cooks is
known to be over two hundred. The working
expenses of the palace are roughly estimated to
be somewhere about £5000 a day. This
enormous sum is, of course, paid out of the
Sultan's Civil List. The revenues of the Civil
List are very great, and they are drawn from
many sources. Nearly all the estates and
farms of high value, and most of the fertile
districts in Anatolia and Syria, and more
especially in the provinces of Baghdad and on
the Persian Gulf, are now entirely at the disposal
of the Sultan, and constitute the source
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>of his private income. Moreover, as every
vestige of power is nowadays in his hands, he
can draw as much money as he requires from
the State exchequer at the Finance Ministry.</p>

<p>The fixed income of the sovereign is supposed
to be £50,000 a month. The Sublime
Porte had at one time the courage to reduce
it to £30,000, but, as I explained before,
the Porte is now only nominally existent
For the last twenty years or more, during
which the revenues of the Civil List have increased
enormously, the officials at the head of
the department have, without exception, been
of Armenian nationality. The first of these
Armenian officials, a certain Aghob Pasha, was
the man who suggested to the Sultan the idea
of appropriating the property of the prominent
Mussulmans in the province. The Civil List is
never in need of money, as is the public exchequer
of Turkey, yet many officials who serve
solely for the palace, and do practically nothing
for the public welfare, get their salaries from the
public exchequer. The sum which the exchequer
has to contribute to the fund of the Palace
espionage system alone is estimated to be
£90,000 a year. Besides the expenses of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>Imperial household, only the salaries of the
immediate officials of the court, and the cost of
the Sultan's largess of money, presents, and
gifts, are defrayed by the Civil List Even the
allowances of the Princes and Princesses of the
Royal House are paid by the public exchequer,
and it is for this reason that the members of
the Dynasty (who, by the way, live in separate
minor palaces, in compulsory seclusion, and
whose intercourse with the nation the Sultan's
jealousy and suspicion has cut off), like the
officials of the State, always find their salaries
in arrears, to their great inconvenience.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br /><br />

<small>THE CEREMONY OF THE SELAMLIK.</small><br /><br /></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The old right of appeal to the Sultan's person a thing of
the past&mdash;He only leaves his palace once a week&mdash;The
selamlik&mdash;Religious ceremonies and the sacred caravan&mdash;Its
departure for Mecca&mdash;A military display&mdash;
Abd-ul-Hamid's mosque&mdash;Its convenient proximity to
the palace&mdash;A study in precaution&mdash;Dwarfs in the
palace.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the Sultan has concentrated all governing
power in his own palace, it might be thought
that the palace was the place to which all who
seek for justice and the redress of wrongs would
come. This is far from being the case With
the exception of the spies, no one can enter any
of the palace departments unless he can give a
good account of himself and the nature of his
business. The unfortunate subjects of the
Sultan who are not connected with the palace
officials some way or other must waste time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>and money in frequenting the old ministerial
offices, which are nowadays only nominally
existent, to seek justice and to find redress for
their cases. There is no hope for these millions
of unhappy subjects in their appeal. Until
about ten years ago anyone who wanted redress
for wrongs and injustice done to him had a
chance, however slender, of appealing to the
Sultan personally, and this he used to do by
forcing his way through the crowd and presenting
a petition to him while he was driving to
the mosque on the occasion of the selamlik,
the only time when Abd-ul-Hamid ventures out
of his fortified palace. But there is now no
possibility of presenting a petition to the Sultan,
as the ceremony of selamlik is conducted
differently.</p>

<p>From time to time the Turkish term 'selamlik'
may be seen in the English papers, but
only those who are fortunate enough to travel
in foreign countries, or those whose position
affords them exceptional opportunities of acquiring
information on matters concerning other
lands, know what this term signifies. The
selamlik is a great military ceremony which
takes place when the head of the Ottoman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>empire goes forth from his palace to a place of
worship, with pomp and circumstance, every
Friday afternoon. 'Selam' means 'salutation,'
and the 'selamlik' is the name given to the
military honour rendered to the sovereign on
that occasion.</p>

<p>Besides the usual selamlik, there are five
annual occasions when the same pageant takes
place; on these occasions, however, the ceremony
is on a grander scale, and the sovereign
meets all civil, military, religious and legal
functionaries of the State who may at the time
be residing in the capital. Two of these
selamliks are held on two great yearly festivals,
the third on the fifteenth of the month of the
fast, when the whole body of Government, from
the monarch downwards, pays homage to the
relics of the Prophet, and the fourth on the
Prophet's birthday, when the high State dignitaries
assemble in one of the great mosques to
listen to the choral recitation of the poem on
the Nativity. The fifth is on the day of the
'sacred caravan,' when a grand pageant takes
place to celebrate its starting. Although the
Sultan does not come out, he is supposed to
salute this quaint procession from the window of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>his palace, and the people greatly enjoy watching
and following it, as it has more religious
colour than the other royal processions. This
sacred caravan starts from the Sultan's capital
every year, about the middle of the Mohammedan
lunar month of Ramazan. The boxes in
which are contained the presents and gifts for
the holy cities of Mecca and Medina are carried
by camels with gorgeously ornamented saddles
through the streets of Constantinople, while
about a dozen Arabs, who are supposed to go
with the caravan to Mecca, display their skill in
swordsmanship in every crowded centre, their
drummer playing rapidly and violently the
while. Thousands of spectators watch the
procession. Before the start of the caravan,
well-to-do people get ready and send alms,
presents and bakhsheesh for the guides, and
gifts for the religious trustees of their respective
families in the cities of the Holy Land. The
most conspicuous features in this procession are
the sedan-chair-like seats, which are screened
with beautifully embroidered silk stuff, for the
protection of the persons seated therein from
the heat of the sun; these seats are fixed on
the saddles of the camels.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span></p>
<p>The cavalcade is escorted by mounted troops,
and is followed by an immense crowd. It is a
really picturesque sight when the long train
mounts the hills of Yildiz to proceed to the
palace; the road leading to the palace is lined
by the magnificent Imperial Guards, and the
wooded hills on both sides of the road are
crowded with a great multitude of lady spectators,
clad in cloaks, umbrellas, and veils of
every colour imaginable. This is an entirely
Mohammedan gathering, and a very orderly
one too; quarrelling, or even disputing between
individuals, is hardly ever to be seen; profound
silence prevails among the crowd; only a
murmur here and there of someone praying for
the success of the year's pilgrimage is now and
then to be heard. After offering a public
prayer in front of the palace of the Caliphate,
the cavalcade proceeds downward to the shore,
whence, in a special boat, it crosses the Bosphorus
to the Asiatic side of the city.</p>

<p>In bygone ages this cavalcade used to
proceed by land all the way from Scutari to
Hijaz, but it is now despatched to Beyrout by
steamer, and the real sacred caravan is not
formed till the gifts reach Damascus, whither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>they are brought under the superintendence of
a court official who is styled the Sorra Emini,
that is to say, the Intendant of the Offering.
Thousands of pilgrims await the starting of the
caravan from Damascus, and go to Hijaz along
with it; for, as the caravan is escorted by troops,
they are thus securely protected against the
attacks of the Bedouin brigands, the only
enemies of the harmless and God-fearing pilgrims.
Still, notwithstanding this protection,
there are cases on record when the sharp and
dexterous Bedouin thief, by approaching quietly
at night and hiding himself behind the long
legs of the camels, has succeeded in robbing and
murdering poor pilgrims, and then disappearing
amid the waves of sand. There are many
pilgrims who prefer the desert route to the sea
journey via Jeddah, not on account of any
material advantage, but simply that they may
suffer greater hardships, hoping that they will
be more highly rewarded by Providence, for
they imagine that their recompense will be
proportionate to the suffering they endure in
fulfilling their religious duties. This is the same
spirit which moves many Russian devotees,
who, when going to Jerusalem, do not take the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>train from Jaffa, but prefer walking all the way
to the Holy City, carrying their sacks and bags
on their shoulders. Besides these annual processions
and the progress of the sacred caravan
procession, there is, as I have said, the usual
ceremony, which takes place every Friday.
This ceremony is better known to Europeans.
The Sultan usually receives the diplomatic
representatives of the Powers, and any foreign
dignitaries who may happen to be in Constantinople
on a visit, after this Friday selamlik.</p>

<p>The procession of the sovereign from the
palace to one or other of the great mosques
every Friday afternoon, attended with an imposing
military display, is a strictly observed
ancient usage. The Sultan must go to the
mosque in public unless prevented by some
urgent matter over which he has no control.
For dynastic considerations, however, even such
urgent matter must, if possible, be set aside, as
some suspicion as to the Sultan's being no
longer alive might spread among the population,
and might bring about a public restlessness
not unfraught with danger, and perhaps
some revolutionary complications. The present
Sultan is much more careful than any of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>immediate predecessors in fulfilling this obligation
of going to the mosque on Fridays.
Whenever a rumour gets abroad concerning his
being indisposed, he promptly orders his representatives
in foreign countries to contradict
the report, and that immediately, lest the news
should find its way back to Turkey, and spread
among its population. He professes to be always
in the best of health. But he is no doubt
subject to the ailments that more or less beset
all humanity, and it is probably these that make
him every now and then look dreadfully pale
and broken-down during the Friday ceremony.
Still, he comes out on these occasions most
regularly.</p>

<p>The former Sultans used to go to different
great mosques of the capital on Fridays on
horseback, amidst the acclamations not only of
the guards but also of the people. But Sultan
Hamid has had a mosque built for himself just
outside the great walls of his fortified palace.
Shortly before the time of the selamlik the
troops of the first and second divisions of the
army of the capital flood the neighbourhood of
that mosque. First come the battalions of the
Albanian Zouaves, now the Arab Zouaves, now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>the marines, and now the battalions of the Anatolian
infantry. They form several lines deep
along the short road. Cavalry regiments take
up their positions in two lines just behind the
infantry. Gendarmes form another line at the
back of the horsemen, and behind them policemen
stand in groups of two at every few steps.
Spies, who may be recognised by their
treacherous and suspicious appearance, wander
about in the immediate neighbourhood. The
wretched public can nowadays see nothing but
the arrival and the return of the troops. Woe
to any educated-looking 'Young-Turk' who
may be suspected by these dirty spies of
attempting to approach the lines! Students of
the military colleges are ordered not to go to
the neighbourhood of the palace on that day.
All the officers commanding these battalions
are raised from the ranks, because such ignorant
officers recognise no one so sacred after Allah
as the Caliph, whereas an educated and intelligent
officer might in all probability be a
'Young-Turk.'</p>

<span class="center">HAMIDIEH MOSQUE.</span></a></div>

<p>What goes on inside the walls formed by
the bodies of so many thousand armed men?
When the time approaches for the departure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>of the imperial carriage from the gates of the
Yildiz Palace, a trumpet is blown, and all the
troops simultaneously give three loud cheers.
The words uttered are these: "Padishahim chok
yasha," or long live the Emperor. Then the
bands of the different regiments strike up one
after another the Sultan's march. The Sultan
drives in a light carriage drawn by four horses;
occasionally the marshal of the palace sits on
the front seat facing him, and sometimes he is
accompanied by his youngest son. His carriage
is immediately followed by a couple of hundred
of the household officers and aides-de-camp.
He salutes the troops calmly, but at the same
time his grave face betrays nervousness, which
he always feels when he is in public. At the
moment of his passing between the lines of
troops a deep silence reigns, and if any irregular
movement, such as an attempt to present a
petition to the Sultan by any individual soldier,
occurs, several spies suddenly appear as it were
from nowhere, and the most perfect order is
resumed. When the Sultan arrives at the
gate of the mosque, which it does not take him
more than three or four minutes to reach, about
half a dozen dwarfs, brought for the occasion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>from their residence in one of the ancient
palaces, cry out in chorus: "Become not over-proud,
my Padishah; there is one who rules
over you also&mdash;that is Allah!" This is one of
the few old customs which have been preserved
to the present day. The Sultan remains in his
private gallery in the mosque for the prayer,
and from the window he views the march past
of the troops, and then, after twenty minutes or
so, returns to his palace with a little less pomp.
No doubt he feels very happy when he has
returned in safety to his fortress-palace, from
which he will not issue till the dreaded Friday
comes round once more, when he must, however
unwillingly, venture out again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br /><br />

<small>THE SULTAN'S POLICY.</small><br /><br /></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The Sultan's personal power&mdash;The unimportance of
territories&mdash;"Après moi le deluge"&mdash;Interested Europe&mdash;The
poor native Christians&mdash;'Squeezability' of the
Sultan&mdash;Every man has his price&mdash;Bakhsheesh and
decorations&mdash;The Sultan's vast ability&mdash;His favourite
literature.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> object of the Sultan in sacrificing so much
money, and in making such strenuous efforts to
concentrate all the ruling power in his own
hands, is simply that he may satisfy his extraordinary
and insatiable lust of tyranny. To
gain this end he deceives, bribes, and intrigues,
and to this end also he exiles, imprisons, and
even makes away with anyone who seems likely
to be an obstacle to his ambition of absolutism.
He has lost the fairest provinces of his empire
through persisting in carrying on his tyrannical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>misrule, and he will not mind losing more in
the same manner so long as there are enough
territories to keep him going during his lifetime,
for his motto is "Après moi le deluge."
He has destroyed all semblance of personal
liberty in the country. There can be no longer
any hope of checking his oppression, which is
becoming more and more severe as the years
go by, as any united movement of opposition is
impossible among so many communities as are
found in Turkey, whose aspirations, thoughts,
and racial tendencies are so widely different.
On the other hand, the Foreign Powers would
not tolerate the outbreak of an open revolution
in Constantinople, whatever the grounds or
reason for it. Some of them even are much
interested in assuring the existence of the
Sultan's rule, and would probably actively
interfere in case of a movement to upset it.
For the purpose of Turkey's ruin this Sultan
has been much more useful to Russia than, all
her great armies of Cossacks.</p>

<p>There are now new factors in the old Eastern
Question, which also serve the Sultan well in
times of political trouble. That is, there are
certain Powers which are much interested in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>the continuance of the Sultan's personal rule,
and whatever the Turkish subjects lose through
misgovernment is a gain for these interested
friends of the present ruler. The Emperor of
Germany, in one of his numerous friendly telegrams
to the Sultan, prayed that the Almighty
might preserve his 'precious person,' doubtless
that the Teutonic concession-hunters and
fortune-seekers in Turkey might continue to
reap the harvest his life assures to them. If
there is really any justice in heaven, I feel sure
l that the Kaiser will be arraigned before the
heavenly bar to answer for his responsibility
in assisting Abd-ul-Hamid to increase the
sufferings of Turkey. His telegrams and visits
to Constantinople have been the principal factor
in encouraging Abd-ul-Hamid in the continuance
of his oppressive policy. These visits and
telegrams have been purposely represented to
the unenlightened population of Turkey, who
have no longer any means of learning the real
position of the Sultan, as the payment of
homage due to their master's greatness. If
the head of a great European nation pays
homage to Abd-ul-Hamid, his simple-minded
subjects will naturally be impressed by his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>mighty influence, and consequently submit to
his autocratic will.</p>

<p>There are other Powers which are equally to
be condemned for conniving at the Sultan's
tyranny. From time to time they hypocritically
take up the cause of this or that Christian
population of Turkey for their own political
purposes, and put pressure upon the Sultan,
because they know well his 'squeezability,'
as a London paper once termed his manner of
receiving pressure. In individuals such conduct
would be regarded as a species of black-mailing,
but it is perhaps compatible with the
political morality of civilised States. The
conduct of France in the temporary occupation
of Mitylene, and of Italy in making an intimidating
naval display off Tripoli, in bombarding
an Ottoman town on the Red Sea,
and in forcibly opening Italian post-offices in
Albania, are the most recent examples of this
international morality. However, Abd-ul-Hamid
will never be much affected by Turkey
having to submit to such indignities so long' as
his precious person is left untouched and his
personal rule unchecked. Never did a self-respecting
man carry selfishness so far!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span></p>
<p>The Sultan has many ways of making his
person safe against responsibility and reproach.
Among other things, I may mention here his
employment of agents of many nationalities in
Europe, who constantly write and say nice
things about him. Even his oft-quoted presents
to other Oriental dignitaries and his innumerable
gifts to Europeans are offered from the
same calculating motive; no sentimental generosity
could be expected from so practical and
selfish a man. In order to give an idea of how
largely the Sultan employs this method, I will
say something about the nature of his presents
and gifts. From the moment of his accession
up to the present time, Sultan Abd-ul-Hamid
has constantly believed that he can win the
golden opinions of the humbler and gain the
sympathy of the higher members of the political
circles with whom he is brought into contact
by presenting them with some sort of grants
or gifts. In fact, he is firmly of the opinion
that everyone has his price, that every person
may be bought, if not always by offers of
gold, then indirectly by honours or gifts.
In order to make his officials submissive, he
gives some of them Government appointments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>of much higher grade than they really deserve;
he grants them purses of bakhsheesh, and he
decorates them lavishly. To gain some idea
of how much the Sultan spends in keeping his
creatures submissive, one would have to pay a
visit of inspection to the Privy Purse Department
at the imperial palace of Yildiz; there
one could see greedy-eyed, yet gratified-looking
individuals carrying away in white linen purses
quantities of the precious metals. Then, if one
glances at the pages of the Constantinople
papers, one will see that dozens of unknown
and probably undeserving creatures are decorated,
promoted, or else appointed to some
newly created posts. A correspondent of a
certain French journal at the Turkish capital
once counted the numbers of one particular
order distributed, that called <i>Shefekat Nishani</i>,
which, like many other decorations, has been
created by the present Sultan, and is given to
ladies of distinction, whether Ottoman or
foreign. According to the Frenchman's
reckoning, about twenty-five thousand gifts
of this order have been made up till now.
The old Turkish orders of the <i>Medjidieh</i> and
<i>Osmanieh</i> are nowadays being so freely dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>tributed,
that the breasts of even the most
ordinary Government servants are ornamented
by one or other of them.</p>

<p>Decorated people are so numerous among
the members of the Sultanic bureaucracy that
it is hardly possible to meet any official, high
or low, without one decoration or more. It is
not surprising, then, that there is a class of
persons, honest, educated, and of good birth,
outside the circle of the Palace favourites, who
boast, and very rightly too, that "they are
honoured by being undecorated."</p>

<p>Decoration and promotion are not the only
methods by which his Majesty imagines that
he can gain attachment to himself. He takes
a different way when it is the sympathy of
foreigners he desires to win. It may, perhaps,
be possible for the Sultan to induce foreign
correspondents and the editors of some Continental
journals to write nice things about him
by offering them bakhsheesh or stars, or by
giving them commercial, industrial, or other
concessions in Turkey. But how is he to gain
the golden opinions of the foreign rulers and
statesmen interested in the Eastern Question?
Is it possible to make an incorruptible British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>Minister, for example, speak favourably of his
Majesty's rule, by conferring on him some
order set with brilliants, or by quietly offering
him a big bakhsheesh? Certainly not But
the Sultan has an unshakable belief in the
wisdom of an Arab proverb, which says,
"Man is the slave of favours"; and so, if he
cannot offer money or decorations, he will
request the acceptance of some keepsake, with
a hypocritical affability peculiar to himself.</p>

<p>The presents of the Sultan vary, of course,
both in quality and quantity. Decorations set
in brilliants, gold snuff-boxes, cigarette-cases
and holders, watches initialled and ornamented
with precious stones, magnificent Arab horses,
richly worked Oriental swords, daggers, and
pistols from the imperial Treasury, which was
most sacredly preserved intact by all the former
Sultans of the House of Osman: such things
form the greater part of the gifts sent to
European potentates and notabilities. Others
are made in the imperial factories.</p>

<p>Among the great personages who get
presents from the Sultan, the German
Emperor is the most highly favoured. Besides
having received numerous and valuable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>keepsakes during his two visits to the Ottoman
capital, the Kaiser gets from time to time Arab
horses and objects of the rarest Eastern skill
and art The Emperor of Russia also receives
presents from the Sultan every now and then,
but his Russian Majesty is generous in sending
presents to the Sultan in return. A summer
mansion on the Bosphorus was given by the
Sultan to the Prince of Montenegro about ten
years ago, and a steam-yacht, which was built
in the State dockyards on the Golden Horn,
was recently sent to the Adriatic for the use of
the same petty ruler. Lord Salisbury received
some two years ago a very large and magnificent
vase, which was brought to England by a
special aide-de-camp of the Sultan, and was
presented to the Prime Minister by the late
Turkish Ambassador.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><a name="i184" id="i184">
<img src="images/i_pg184fp.jpg" width="500" height="331" alt="AN OLD SERAGLIO." />
<span class="center">AN OLD SERAGLIO.</span></a></div>

<p>Whether these various devices had any
real effect or no, the Sultan has certainly
succeeded in attaining the object he desired;
he still remains on his throne, and his power
is absolute. This alone, when one reflects
upon the history of the reign of the present
Sultan, makes one fully admit that he is a man
of vast ability. His ability has, however, been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>productive solely of evil. If he were a good
as well as an able man, his country would be
powerful and prosperous. His indifference to
insults and hatred, his calmness in dealing with
difficulties of the most perplexing kind, and
his tenacity of purpose are remarkable. Unlike
many of his predecessors, he is not much
under the influence of women; nor does he care
for their company, though he still maintains m
his palace the old system of the harem, with
its numerous inmates and slaves, possibly only
for the purpose of impressing the uncultivated
section of his subjects with the sight of barbaric
splendour. His phenomenal shrewdness is
shown by his making the Mussulmans believe
that the misfortunes endured by Turkey under
his caliphate are entirely due to the hostile
interference of grasping Europe with Turkish
affairs. To Europeans, on the other hand,
he often succeeds in conveying the impression
that the people in whose name he rules are
incapable of appreciating the value of progressive
and constitutional government, and
in order to justify this, he puts every obstacle
in the way of their making progress in industry,
science and literature. Sultan Abd-ul-Hamid,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>although he has played so notable a rôle in the
preservation of his own personal sovereignty,
is a man of but poor educational attainments.
It is said by those who know him well that
before his accession he was considered far
inferior to the other royal princes of his house
in attainments and culture. In spite of this
drawback, he has for over twenty-six years
shown himself superior to all opposition,
rivalry, and attack.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that he works harder than
any man in Turkey, and that he reads and
makes his secretaries read to him a great deal;
but what he reads principally consists of the
reports of his spies and agents, which pour in
in hundreds every day. Besides these, his
favourite literature, which is translated from
many languages and read aloud to him, is
composed of biographies and historical sketches
of the despotic sovereigns of the world and
their doings, and also of their enemies, so that
he is interested in accounts of the organisation
of secret societies and conspiracies. He is
also passionately fond of all kinds of detective
stories.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br /><br />

<small>THE STRUGGLE WITH YOUNG-TURKEY.</small><br /><br /></h2>

<blockquote>

&mdash;The 'humanity' of Europe&mdash;Attempts on the
Sultan's life&mdash;Lack of organisation in Young-Turkey&mdash;
refuge for the reformers in England&mdash;The short-lived

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> spite of all the measures taken by the Sultan
to preserve his personal rule, he has met at
times with serious opposition from a section of
his Turkish subjects, the only people in Turkey
who see the state of affairs clearly and can read
the signs of their country's decadence. They
understand that, among the peoples of the
Ottoman empire, the Turkish race, in whose
name the misrule of a cosmopolitan Palace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>faction is maintained, suffer most from the
existing tyranny. These men compose what
is commonly known in Europe as 'the Young Turkish
Party.' By them attempts have been
made now and then to rid the throne of Abd-ul-Hamid,
and for this reason there has been a
constant struggle between them and the Sultan.
He is aware that the Turks, unlike his non-Mohammedan
subjects, would not allow themselves
to be tools for the political designs
of any European Power, and therefore would
never be likely to receive foreign help against
his tyranny. Consequently he feels at liberty to
deal with them in a much more absolute fashion
than with any of his other subjects. And so,
with a relentless determination, he does all he
can to crush any of the Turks who may attempt
to check him. If they escape from his hands
and fly to other countries, he will make almost
any sacrifice to get hold of them again. It is
said that he connived at the French designs on
Tunis in order to get Midhat Pasha from the
French consulate at Smyrna, when the latter
took refuge there. Quite recently an Italian
consul in Switzerland called on the late Mahmud
Pasha, the Sultan's brother-in-law and enemy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>who was staying at Lucerne, and requested him
not to go to Italy, because the Government of
that country wished to be on good terms with
the Sultan; and this was at a time when Italy
was making an intimidating naval show in the
Albanian and Tripolitan waters. It is an open
secret that the Sultan's representatives have
often approached some European Foreign
Offices with the promise of concessions to be
granted on condition that the Turkish refugees in
their territories were handed over to the Sultan,
or at any rate expelled across the frontiers.</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of his uniform success in the
struggle with his Turkish subjects, the Sultan
has more than once been face to face with
imminent danger owing to the efforts of this
party. The most daring of these attempts was
made by a certain Suavi Effendi, whose name
I mentioned before, who was a very cultured
as well as courageous member of the <i>Ulema</i>
class, and was one of the organisers of the once
powerful Young-Turkish movement Suavi
Effendi was in London about thirty-five years
ago, finding it safer to print here the political
literature of the movement to be smuggled into
Turkey, but before the fall of the late Sultan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>he went back to Constantinople, and was
engaged in educational and journalistic work.
Soon after the accession of Abd-ul-Hamid,
Suavi collected a band of some hundreds of
desperate refugees, who had flocked into the
capital from the provinces which were lost as
the consequence of the Russo-Turkish War,
and with them he attacked the Sultan's palace.
Before, however, they could release the ex-Sultan
Murad from his captivity, to be reinstated
in his place, they were overtaken by
the guards in the palace garden, and, after
a fearful struggle, Suavi and most of his followers
perished. The mere rustic private
who is credited with having cut Suavi Effendi
himself down is now the all-powerful Hassan
Pasha, the present head of the police guarding
those quarters of the capital which border on
Yildiz Kiosk. He is a man of great physical
strength and ferocity. Most men who are
denounced as being Young-Turkish adherents
are handed over to him before being sent
into exile, and terrible tales are related about
his beating the prisoners. The Sultan not
long ago conferred on him the rank of a
Field-Marshal for his loyal service, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>Hassan is so ignorant that he cannot even write
his own name.</p>

<p>Another attempt to depose the Sultan was
made some twenty years ago by a Circassian
cavalry regiment which was quartered near
Yildiz Kiosk. The men of the Circassian
regiment, who evidently had lady friends in the
harem of the palace, laid a plot against Abd-ul-Hamid.
They also failed at the last moment
in their attempt, and the regiment speedily and
mysteriously disappeared. The last projected
attempt of a serious nature was reported to
have been nearly carried out during the
Armenian troubles. At that time the door of
the Sultan's room was guarded by two Kurds,
and these men were the disciples of a religious
order which prescribes to its followers a self-sacrificing
devotion towards their sheikhs or
chiefs. The sheikh of this order, who was won
over by the adherents of the Reform Party,
explained to his two Kurdish followers the true
character of the man who occupied the office of
the caliphate, and, according to the same report,
they both bound themselves by an oath
to get rid of him when their turn came to guard
his room. Fate was, however, again on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>side of Abd-ul-Hamid, and the plot failed in
due course.</p>

<p>About the progressive element which has
inspired and maintained so obstinate an opposition
to the Sultan, much has been heard in
England, but little is really known. I will
therefore touch upon its history, aims, and
present position.</p>

<p>The common name for this element, the
'Young-Turkish Party,' though widely used,
is inaccurate, and I do not propose to use it
myself in connection with these advocates of
the progressive reform. There is no organised
body such as could properly be called a 'party,'
though on various occasions different societies
have been formed by agitators for reform, whose
chief aims and aspirations have been identical;
namely, to check the Sultanic absolutism, to
secure a representative mode of government,
and introduce necessary reforms. The growth
of the revolutionising element in Turkey cannot
be traced to the influence of the French
Revolution; it was due to the introduction, for
the first time, of English ideas of liberty, and
the spread of information about the English
system of constitutional government It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>perhaps known to few that the first Ottoman
reformer was a member of the first Ottoman
diplomatic mission to the Court of St James's.
Agah Effendi, the first Turkish Ambassador
who was accredited in England, some hundred
years ago, was accompanied by a young man
named Ra-if Mahmud Effendi, who acted as
his private secretary. This young secretary
remained in England many years and devoted
himself to the study of scientific subjects,
more especially geography, and afterwards
published a translation of an English atlas into
Turkish, the first ever prepared in that language.
While in England, Mahmud Effendi used to
send reports to the Sublime Porte on the forms
of administration and system of government in
this country. When Sultan Mahmud II. came
to the throne, the young diplomatist was invited
to Constantinople to assist in the work of
reorganising the administration; but during
one of the fanatical outbursts which preceded
the extermination of the Janissary corps, this
first modernised statesman of Turkey was
accused of being a man of 'broad views,' and
killed in a <i>mélée</i>. The seeds of reform sown
by him, however, were not entirely destroyed;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>and it was chiefly owing to the work of the
later Turkish statesmen, who followed his
example in reorganising the system of their
country, that the famous Hatt-i Sherif, or first
reform charter of the Ottoman empire, was
drawn up, and, with the assistance of the
friendly Powers, proclaimed.</p>

<p>As I said before, it is not correct to call the
Ottoman empire a part of the 'unchanging
East'; Turkey has seen many essential changes
during the last century, though not always
for the better. Shortly after his accession to
the throne, the late Sultan Abd-ul-Aziz attempted
to disregard the newly established
statutes of the empire, and to rule in a most
unconstitutional fashion. Instead of following
the constitutional methods of the country which
had previously contributed to the consolidation
of his empire, he adopted the absolutism of
the Russian autocracy, and a Palace Party
was formed to combat the then growing
national liberalism. The young reformers of
that period ventured to criticise vehemently
the arbitrary conduct of the Sultan and his
advisers. But the country was not sufficiently
educated to give them support, so their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>remonstrances were severely punished by the
Government. Some of the leaders were imprisoned
in different citadels throughout the
empire, but others managed to escape to
Europe. Some of these fugitives settled in
London. It is now more than thirty years
since an active movement for reform was started
by the 'Young-Turks,' as they were then first
styled. The reformers published pamphlets
and journals in England, and sent them out to
Turkey by means unknown to the Sultan Aziz's
officials. Being men of letters of recognised
ability, they contributed considerably by their
writings to the enlightenment of public opinion
in their country, and did a good deal for the
cause of education among their countrymen.
The effects of their agitation began to be felt
by the Palace Party and the corrupt officials of
the old school in the Sublime Porte.</p>

<p>About the beginning of the unfortunate reign
of the present Sultan, the reformers found so
many adherents among the educated classes of
the people, as well as in the army, that Abd-ul-Hamid
thought it imperative to promise to
Midhat Pasha, the chief reformer, that immediately
after his coronation he would proclaim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>constitutional law, and sanction an assembly
of the representatives of the various communities
of the empire. He did as he said, but he
was only waiting for an opportunity of making
away with the leaders of the constitutional
movement and of re-establishing the personal
rule of the sovereign. The war with Russia
in 1877 gave him his opportunity; as the
Turkish people were suffering from the terrible
results of the war, they were not in a position
to forestall the evil designs of Yildiz Kiosk,
and to make the friends of Turkey in Western
Europe understand that the only way of preserving
the integrity of the empire was through
the formation of a responsible constitutional
government. The short-lived Ottoman constitution,
which Abd-ul-Hamid destroyed, was
therefore the work of the Young-Turkish Party,
who aimed at the regeneration of their country
by founding a "reasonable representative
Government," to quote a phrase of the late Mr
Gladstone, and was not merely a ruse on the
part of the Sultan whereby "he might throw
dust into the eyes of the Western Powers," as
the irreconcilable enemies of the Ottoman
empire interpreted it Mr Gladstone and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>political friends, however, never really sympathised
with the attempts to establish such a
government in Turkey. The late Duke of
Argyll said, in one of his books on Eastern
matters, "We in England laughed at their
constitution." As a matter of fact, these
politicians of England wanted reforms only
for the Christian subjects of the empire.</p>

<p>Thus, after the Russo-Turkish war, the
country was not able to give material support
to the Reform 4 Party,' while, on the other
hand, this party received no effective support
from the well-wishers of the Ottoman empire
in England. The Yildiz junta took full advantage
of this, made the constitution a dead letter,
got rid of the most powerful and most honest
reformers by sending them as governors or
mere exiles to distant provinces, and established
a bureaucratic authority of the most intolerably
oppressive kind, the misrule of which has
caused the Ottoman empire irreparable harm.
In the hope of preventing the formation of an
opposition party, Abd-ul-Hamid began to stir
up the old religious and racial hatreds, which
were then almost dead, among the various
nationalities of the empire, and to crush every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>sort of industrial energy and collective enterprise
of the people. He further threatened
private property, more especially of the reform
adherents, with confiscation on the slightest
excuse. In spite, however, of fiendish and
systematic persecution of the reformers and
their followers, the Sultan has never succeeded
in entirely stamping out the reform movement
He was too late in his attempt to suppress
education, and the spread of Western learning
among the Turkish people has brought about
the dissemination of the ideas of Western
Europe as to the legitimate liberty of the
people and the responsibility of the government;
hence, discontent among the more
thoughtful of the community has steadily gone
on increasing.</p>

<p>About the beginning of the Armenian revolt
there was an energetic revival of the reform
agitation. The would-be reformers earnestly
tried to upset the misrule of the Sultan
Abd-ul-Hamid. They wanted a brave Sultan
to rule over a brave people; they wanted an
honest sovereign, not an intriguer, clever
enough when his personal safety is concerned,
but otherwise a lunatic, who has shut himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>up in his fortified palace for the last six-and-twenty
years; they wanted a worthy Caliph,
who would impress the Mohammedan world
with the fact that as a Mohammedan power
Turkey had a respectable position among the
civilised powers of Europe; they wanted a
responsible Turkish Ministry, not a cosmopolitan
clique of adventurers, whose misrule brought the
very name of the Turkish nation into contempt.
Persecution of some twenty-five thousand Young-Turkish
adherents did not prove sufficient to
suppress this movement. Therefore the Sultan
had to devise further ingenious means for
bringing it to naught Many of his spies
fled to Europe as though they were Young-Turks,
and joined the different Young-Turkish
committees; they reported secretly everything
they discovered concerning them to the Sultan,
and tried to sow discord among the members.
As most of the fugitives depended for their
livelihood on their resources in Turkey, the
Sultan succeeded in driving them into the
utmost destitution by cutting off these resources.
Meanwhile his emissaries came forward with
large sums of money and with promises of
appointments in Government offices, to induce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>the refugees to return to Turkey. Some of
them accepted the pecuniary assistance of his
benevolent Majesty, and therefore lost the
sympathy of the Turkish people. Certain
office-seekers and concession-hunters, some of
whom were not Turks at all, pretending to be
Turkish reformers, published seditious papers in
London and elsewhere in order to blackmail the
Sultan, and in this way brought shame upon
the honour of the Young-Turks.</p>

<p>Thus the Young-Turkish movement is
disorganised, but it has not been wholly
suppressed. It may reorganise its forces,
and continue its campaign against the Yildiz
monsters, though in a pacific manner; because
an armed uprising against the tyranny of
Abd-ul-Hamid by the Turks alone would be
represented in Europe as prelude to a 'massacre
of the Christians.' Moreover, such a
revolution would be a bloody one, for Yildiz
Kiosk is guarded by armed men of different
races, hostile to one another. Besides, in case
of an extreme danger to his person, the Sultan
would open the gates of the capital to the forces
of the traditional enemy of Turkey, as he has
on more than one occasion hinted.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br /><br />

<small>ENGLAND AND THE CALIPHATE.</small><br /><br /></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>Abd-ul-Hamid's use of his power as Caliph&mdash;What the
Moslems think of him&mdash;British Mohammedan subjects
&mdash;The validity of the Ottoman claims to the Caliphate
&mdash;The mistaken policy of British Statesmen in opposing
them&mdash;Danger of alienating the Mohammedan world&mdash;The
errors of English writers.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> can hardly be found in the history of
nations a more fortunate tyrant than the autocrat
of Yildiz Kiosk. Besides all the circumstances
I have noted, Abd-ul-Hamid has at his
back the authority of the Caliphate, which he
can, when he chooses, ingeniously employ for
his own ends. The devotion of the Mussulmans
of Turkey and the respect of orthodox
Mohammedans of other countries for the Caliph
are very great, and becoming greater every
day. As a matter of fact, the attachment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>of Mohammedans is to the office of the Caliph
rather than to his person, and according to the
qualities necessary for the man who holds it, a
true Caliph must be a perfect specimen of
humanity. If he cannot fulfil the prescribed
conditions of the Islamic religious law, that law
orders the faithful to depose him, and justifies
the election of a proper Caliph. There are not
lacking in the history of Islam instances in which
the Caliph has been deposed solely on these
religious grounds. It is almost impossible for
these people to comprehend that the present
Sultan does not possess any of these good
qualities, and is therefore quite unworthy of his
office. The Sultan employs subtle methods
that he may pose before the Mohammedans as
the true Caliph and the sole champion of the
Islamic cause, and spends immense sums of
money for the same purpose. In reality, however,
he should be known as the worst enemy
of Islam, as no Moslem ruler has ever brought
by his misdeeds so much shame upon his faith
as he has. Anyone who has observed his
career closely knows that his actions are
diametrically opposed to the principles of the
Mussulman law and creed. But it is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>hardest thing in the world to make Moslems
understand this. Those in Turkey are just
beginning to understand what he really is,
but outside Turkey he is held in blind veneration
by all Moslems. An Englishman, who
had great experience of the East, and who
followed the Prince of Wales during his tour
round the Colonies, told me that the further
you go away from Turkey the greater is the
influence of the Sultan among the followers of
Islam.</p>

<p>In pursuance of my remarks on the way in
which the Sultan makes use of the influence of
the Caliphate for his personal ends, it may
perhaps be of some interest if I make some
general remarks on the Caliphate, and the influence
of the Caliph among the Mussulmans of
the world. It must be remembered that Great
Britain has under her rule or protection a
very large number of the followers of Islam.
Some authorities say that her Moslem subjects
are five times as many as those who
belong to Turkey itself. It follows that this
immense Mohammedan population in Great
Britain's Eastern dominions will some day
prove of the highest importance in determining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>the direction of her policy in the East There
are now symptoms of rivalry between the
Sultan of Turkey and those British authorities
whose business it is to maintain their country's
prestige and influence in the Moslem world.
It is on account of this rivalry that some
British writers and politicians try to represent
the religious influence of the Sultan as being
less than it is, while others seek to deny the
validity of the Ottoman Caliphate. That
the present Sultan is unworthy of the title
cannot be questioned; but the validity of
the claim of the occupant of the Turkish
throne to the office, quite apart from his character,
is incontestable. Those who deny this,
or seek to depreciate the influence of the
Ottoman Sultanate on orthodox Mohammedans,
periodically shower abuse on Turkey,
as was done during the Armenian agitation,
perhaps with the view of creating a breach
between the Moslem populations of British
territories and Turkey. And I cannot but
think that this policy is having just the
opposite effect. The study of the English
language is increasing steadily but surely
among the Mohammedan subjects of Great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>Britain, and so they read or hear many of the
hostile sentiments published and uttered in
England against the Ottoman Caliphate, and
become suspicious and irritated. In fact, the
more this hostility is displayed, the closer
will become the attachment of the Moslem
subjects of England towards the Ottoman
Caliphate. Such alienation of feeling, which
is at present latent, will be anything but favourable
for England in case of international
complications in some part of the Orient.
There are European Powers who may take
advantage of it, and use it against the interests
of the British Government The speech of
the Kaiser delivered at Damascus must still
be fresh in the memory of many people. It
was certainly with the object of increasing the
influence of his country in the East that he said
that he would stand side by side with the head of
three hundred million Mohammedans. A highly
connected Russian once told me that during
Queen Victoria's reign Great Britain waged over
fifty different wars, small and great, and added
that most of these wars were carried on against
Mohammedan peoples in different parts of Asia
and Africa, in order to crush their independence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>and take their countries. Very likely he used
to relate this to other compatriots or co-religionists
of mine whom he met, so that the idea
became popular, and would add to the belief
that Great Britain is the worst enemy of the
cause of Islam. "Supposing that the fanaticism
of the Mohammedans under our rule were
stirred up by Turkey, what could they do?"
a proud Jingo once asked me, at a time when
some persons were urging Lord Salisbury to
send the British fleet over the mountains of
Asia Minor to avenge the Armenian wrongs.
"We could put them down," added this Jingo,
with an increased air of proud confidence, "any
time and anywhere." Yes, in the East we
know England's might, and we all admire
the Englishman's great tenacity in defence of
the interests of his country. But there are
instances in history of small and backward
nations having inflicted irreparable damage on
mighty Powers, and Mussulmans will not
always fight&mdash;if it should, unfortunately, ever
come to fighting&mdash;with spears and mediæval
weapons. They will not easily be exterminated
or subjugated; nor is it true that the
Mohammedans will ever be won over by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>conversion, as the missionaries assert. These
millions of Mohammedans will continue to
exist, and some day there will certainly be a
general awakening among them, which will
make the adoption of modern methods and
means of war imperative. I do not imagine
that it would be to Turkey's interest to alienate
Great Britain by attempting to stir up her
Moslem subjects, and I am sure that when
once the present regime is over, everyone in
Turkey will heartily, welcome the re-establishment
of England's prestige. There is, therefore,
no sound reason for the attitude of
malignant jealousy towards the Ottoman
Caliphate which some Englishmen have
chosen to adopt It seems to me that past
generations of British statesmen must have
had sounder statesmanlike qualities than the
present generation, for they used to benefit
their country by the influence of that Caliphate.
For instance, during the earlier periods of
the conquest of India, the English representative
in Turkey requested the Porte to
use its good offices in the court of certain
Mohammedan rulers of India in favour of his
country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving the political aspect, I will say something
as to the validity of Turkey's claim to
the Caliphate. In discussing this subject some
English writers use such phrases as the
"pretensions of the Ottoman Sultans" to the
headship of Moslems. So long as the great
bulk of those who profess that religion recognise
that authority, what value can be
attached to the attempts to question it on the
part of prejudiced outsiders? It is argued
that the sect of Shiites, or the unorthodox
Moslems, do not recognise the Caliphate in
question. But there are strong indications
that they too will, sooner or later, recognise
it for political if not religious reasons, as the
danger threatening the remaining vestige of
Islamic independence looms equally large
before orthodox and unorthodox alike. One
of the arguments brought forward against the
Ottoman Caliphate is that the Caliph must be appointed
from among the Koreish, the Prophet's
own people, and must be his direct descendant.
It is probable that the tradition related in
connection with this argument is one of the
many spurious sayings made up by individuals
after the time of Mohammed, as such a just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>legislator would not show partiality towards
his own family and people by restricting to
them the privilege of being his Caliphs.
According to his doctrine, community of faith
is tantamount to community of race, and he
founded a perfect democratic equality between
his followers, whatever their race or
colour, and called them all 'ommetee,' that is,
'my nation.' A Caliph, therefore, need not
necessarily be a descendant of the Prophet
Besides, he left no male issue; and according
to the Moslem law, female issue has not the
right of succession, the Caliph being a temporal
and not a spiritual head.</p>

<p>Another strong argument is the length of
time for which the Ottoman sovereigns have
held the title of Caliph. This title was first
assumed by the Ottomans during the conquest
of Egypt by Sultan Selim I. in 1517 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, when
the keys of the sacred places of Mecca and
Medina were handed over to him at Cairo by a
deputation which came from Hijaz expressly to
accept him as Caliph. From that moment up till
now the Ottoman sovereigns have uninterruptedly
held the title, and have been the guardians
of the standard of Mohammed. The pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>vinces
of Mecca and Medina have ever since
that time formed an integral part of the
Ottoman empire. A Caliph must be an
independent ruler, and must in particular be
ruler over those holy places. It would
certainly never do if an Arab were appointed
as the spiritual head of Islam by a Power of
alien faith. Such mischievous suggestions are
merely an expression of the political hostility
which is often shown by some individuals in
England to the Turkish Caliphate. An ultra-patriotic
evening paper once said that there
could not be a better Caliph than the 'British
Raj.' To make the Mussulmans recognise the
'British Raj.' as the supreme religious head of
their community is as impossible and ridiculous
as to attempt to convert this country to Islam.
If Englishmen are really patriotic in guarding
and promoting the interests and prestige of their
country in the Islamic world, they should not
attack the Ottoman Caliphate, but make good
use of its influence. Such a suggestion as I
have quoted would not appear to the Moslem
mind to be a friend's advice, as the general
tendency among the Mohammedans is to
strengthen the position of the existing Cali<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>phate.
This tendency is becoming so evident
that some Continental journals have already
believed it to be the result of Pan-Islamic
organisation, though in reality there is no such
organisation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br /><br />

<small>A LAST VISIT TO ASIA MINOR.</small><br /><br /></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>I become an object of interest to the Palace spies&mdash;I therefore
leave Constantinople for a time&mdash;England and the
Anatolian Railway&mdash;Prosperous whitewash and a deceitful
governor&mdash;Bureaucratic changes in Asia MinorThe
measures for restricting large gatherings of the

part.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> this time, when I was making a fair living
by means of the business entrusted to me by
those European concessionnaires whom I have
mentioned, I thought it convenient to take up
my residence in Pera, the European quarter of
the capital. But my residing in Pera among
foreigners must have made me an object on
which some persons connected with the Palace
deemed it worth while to keep an eye. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>began to suspect that my movements were
being shadowed by some mysterious individuals,
though I could hardly be sure. I informed my
English friend, the late correspondent of the
Times, that I had reason to fear that the spies
were after me, and that I thought the time had
come to carry out my old intention of going to
England. He agreed with me as to the advisability
of my getting out of Turkey, but he
warned me that unless I secured some means
of livelihood beforehand, it was a most risky
matter to give up my work, my hopes and
probable chances at home, and go over to
a country which was absolutely foreign to me.
A strong presentiment, however, possessed my
mind that I should, sooner or later, be added
to the list of the victims of the prevailing
tyranny. Taking advantage of the approach of
the summer vacation, I thought it would be
better at least to go away for some little
time from Constantinople. My English friend
recommended me to the director of the then
newly opened Anatolian railways, and he gave
me a first-class free ticket to Angora, which I
had not seen for several years. A few days later
I crossed over the harbour of Constantinople to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>the Asiatic shore, and from the Haidar Pasha
terminus I took the train which carried me
away at once towards the heart of Asia Minor.
The distance between Haidar Pasha and
Angora is shorter, I should say, than between
London and Glasgow, yet the express train
takes two whole days to cover it. The German
Railway Company does not seem generous in
affording facilities to the people of the country,
and the customs officers and the rough inspectors
employed by the Tobacco Régie
Company (one of the European companies)
give the traveller an intolerable amount of
trouble by seizing and examining his belongings
at different places on the journey. The train
stops when it has gone half-way on the first
evening, as it is not allowed to run at night
The traveller's inland passport is examined, and
he himself is subjected to a perfect inquisition
of questionings, first in the capital, again on
the first night, and finally on the second night,
when he reaches his destination.</p>

<p>When the Anatolian line was first constructed
as far as Angora, the general belief in the
country was that the long projected trunk line
from the Ottoman capital to the Persian Gulf
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>would pass through Angora. This has not
been the case, and the main line changes
its course at Eski-Shehir, which is situated
half-way between the capital and Angora, and
runs to the south, towards Konia (ancient
Iconium). It is no doubt within the recollection
of many people that the scheme of shortening
and facilitating communication between Europe
and the nearer East and India by constructing
a great line over Asiatic Turkey was first
projected by English engineers, supported by
the British Government. This enterprise, however,
could not be realised. The Germans,
ever ready to seize all commercial and political
ground lost by the English in the nearer
East, took the matter into their own hands,
and are now going to have the control of
what should have been essentially the British
route to India through the friendly Ottoman
empire. I do not know whether the possession
of this line by Germans is a loss to England,
but it is really a loss for my countrymen that
this enterprise should not have been in the
hands of an English company, because they are
aware that in dealing with the English there is
a fair possibility of mutual benefit; while in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>bargaining with Germans, the greediest of all
grasping Europeans, Turkey has little to expect
in return for what she has to give.</p>

<p>On the second evening after my departure
the train arrived at Angora at the moment of
sunset. I saw from the window of my carriage
that some of the mud-walled houses of the
town and the walls of the ancient citadel were
white and glistening. At first I thought that
they were some new buildings which had sprung
up as a sign of the prosperity produced by the
opening of the railway. But I soon discovered
my mistake. The Governor-General had given
orders that the municipal authorities were to
whitewash the citadel and that many of the
citizens were to do the same to their houses
before the formal opening of the railway, so
that the European visitors and official commissioners
who should come to Angora for the
first time might suppose that the town was as
smart and prosperous as it looked. The
governor must have learnt this mode of deception
from the Yildiz authorities, who caused
all the more ruinous quarters of Constantinople
to be whitewashed or surrounded with high
timber hoardings before the German Emperor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>first came to the city. I was particularly
surprised that the great time-worn stones of the
ancient citadel should have been so monstrously
disfigured by a vulgar coat of whitewash. The
governor was a certain Abideen Pasha, and he
is now the Vali of the Turkish Archipelago.
He is an Albanian by birth, and was first
educated in Athens. He can write poems in
ancient Greek, and is known to be a linguist
and scholar. He had been governor of Angora
for several years, yet he had done almost
nothing to improve the condition of the
province. In other countries such a man would
perhaps have been given a professorial chair in
some educational institution, but he would
hardly have been put in a responsible government
post which requires practical administrative
capacity. Turkey cannot expect beneficial
reforms from such learned theorists, any more
than from the ignorant incapable officials who
are still entrusted by the Palace with the administration
of many of the important
provinces.</p>

<p>Some years had elapsed between my last trip
and the present one into Asia Minor, and
during this period I found that serious changes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>had taken place in the state of the interior.
Among other things, the number of useless
officials sent by the central Government had
increased alarmingly, to the detriment of the
inhabitants of the provinces. For instance,
there is no piece of land in Angora which could
properly be called forest, yet a Department of
Woods and Forests had been created there;
directors, sub-directors, and several subordinate
officials had been sent out by the central
government, and in connection with this office
new taxes and unaccustomed laws had been
imposed upon the inhabitants. The fact is
that, in order to show the Powers that it had
been introducing reforms, the Government of
the Sultan had adopted among other laws the
French regulations relating to the management
of forests, and a new department had been
created in Constantinople. This central department
had opened branch offices in all <i>vilayets</i>
or counties, and many Palace favourites were
sent to them as forest officials, without regard
to the circumstances that in some vilayets there
was not an acre which could be considered
forest land. In order to crush local influence
in the government of the provinces, the admin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>istrative
councils of the towns, on which the
notabilities and religious heads of all communities
in each locality, Mussulman and non-Mussulman,
sit ex officio in company with the
officials of the Sultan's Government, were discouraged
from attending meetings.</p>

<span class="center">A WRESTLING MATCH IN OLDEN DAYS.</span></a></div>

<p>Such events as would occasion the gathering
of large crowds were either prohibited or restricted,
after the custom of the capital. "He
who is a traitor is also a coward," said the
Prophet, and Abd-ul-Hamid, who has caused
irreparable harm to Turkey, is afraid that such
gatherings might be the prelude to a general
uprising. I will mention here two things
which used to cause great masses of people to
collect. One was a wedding entertainment,
and the other the war-game of <i>jereed</i>. The
restriction of the former to a 'simpler' form
was, according to the reasons openly given
for it, one of the Sultan's so-called 'paternal'
measures. It was alleged to be necessary
because people on such occasions indulged in
ruinous expenses, and thus fell into the hands
of the Armenian and other money-lenders, and
became victims of their extortions. As a matter
of faot, to maintain a wife is not an expensive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>luxury in Asia Minor, but people are fond of
grand wedding entertainments. Several days
before a wedding, luncheons and dinners are
given to large parties of rich and poor, who are
entertained with string music and spectacles
indoors. A great procession passes through
the chief streets of a town bringing the bride
and bridesmaids in closely shut palanquins,
which are carried by mules or horses. At night
there is a display of fireworks and illuminations
composed of torches, and by day exhibitions of
wrestling are given by local champions.
(Wrestling is one of Turkey's most ancient
and favourite pastimes, and in the provinces
all schoolboys practise it, besides a large
number of adults. It is of the greatest use
in developing the physical strength of the
provincial Turks.) Both the bride's procession
and these outdoor entertainments are accompanied
by the incessant beating of drums and
blowing of long trumpets, or sometimes of a
kind of bagpipe,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> the most favourite and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>fact the only music of the humbler class of
people and peasants. The old national game
of <i>jereed</i>, which used to attract an immense
crowd of spectators, was, I learned on this
visit, also prohibited in Angora. This game
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>used to be most popular in every town of
Asiatic Turkey. On Fridays, in the afternoon,
when the khutba or prayer-oration in the
mosques was over, people used to hasten out of
the towns, mounted on their trained horses, and
armed with several long and heavy sticks.
The <i>jereed</i> is a game for the able-bodied alone.
Two things are essentially necessary for players
&mdash;they must be first&mdash;rate horsemen, and must
be skilled in throwing their sticks straight and
hard while galloping. There are about twenty
men on each side, and they take up their
positions about fifty yards apart The spectators
look on from some high ground, where
there is no danger of their being trampled
upon by the struggling horsemen. The game
is opened by one man, who gallops forward
from one side and throws one of his
sticks at one of the enemy; as soon as he
throws it he is pursued. The pursuers do
the same in their turn, and so the game
goes on. There must be no confusion or
unfairness, and everyone must play his game
'bravely,' as they call it. The sticks must
not wilfully be aimed at the heads of the
enemy. The players are allowed to do any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>thing
to avoid being hit by the sticks, and in
order to avoid it they play risky tricks, such as
bending from the saddle down towards the
neck and belly of their galloping horses. Anyone
who has thrown away all his sticks is free
to pick up any stick lying on the ground, with
a pole which has a hook at the end, or by
dexterously bending down and snatching it up
with his hand as the horse gallops by. Sometimes,
of course, the horses of two opponents
collide, and then most likely both men fall in a
heap, and very often under the horses. The
most exciting way to play the game is that
adopted by a man whose horse is unusually
swift After throwing his stick at the enemy
he does not hurry back towards his own line,
but dashes away toward the open country and
rides as fast as he can. Some of the enemy
pursue him far away down the valley, until he
is either caught up or escapes.</p>

<p>During this last visit the game was no
longer played, because some serious accidents
had happened and lives had been lost, and the
kind Government accordingly prohibited it
Seeing all these prohibitions, I was perhaps
rather injudicious and outspoken in criticising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>the Government. So a relation of mine reminded
me of the old proverb which runs, "A
man's safety lies in holding his tongue." He,
moreover, warned me that times were now
different, and added, "If you are not careful
you will go...." I understood what he
alluded to. He meant, of course, that I should
be sent into exile or thrown into prison if I
went on criticising the existing regime. I did
not stay long in Asia Minor during this last
visit, and after settling my affairs I hastened
my packing and returned to Constantinople,
where it is, comparatively speaking, easier to
find means of getting out of Turkey. With us
there is filial obligation for a man of right
feeling, no matter how old he may be, to
secure his parents' consent to any venture on
which he is going to embark. So, guardedly
and in confidence, I broke to my mother my
intention of going to the land of <i>Ingliz</i>. The
poor Mussulman lady was terrified at the idea,
and began to put to me such questions as&mdash;Who
would look after me? Who would take
care of me in case of my falling ill in that distant
strange land? And if I died there, should I
desire to be buried according to the rites of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>infidels? It perhaps never occurred to her that
there was a danger far greater than those she
instanced&mdash;the danger of falling into destitution
in a foreign land. This was the possibility
which I dreaded most, as I knew that anyone
who left the Sultan's dominions without his
august permission could not depend for his
living upon any resources he might have at
home. So, while I was making ready to return
to Constantinople, my mother entreated me to
renounce the idea of going to England, and to
calm her I was wicked enough to make some
evasive promises, which to me meant nothing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br /><br />

<small>A SPY IN A PUBLIC BATH.</small><br /><br /></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>The Turkish bath&mdash;Some of its features&mdash;Great number of
baths in Constantinople&mdash;Women's baths and a
proverb&mdash;Evening parties at the bath&mdash;I encounter a
spy in a bath&mdash;He is well informed about me&mdash;I am
alarmed&mdash;I appeal to an Englishman for help in
escaping&mdash;The 'cursed country.'</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I came back to Constantinople I decided
to lead a more or less retired life, so that I
might if possible avoid becoming a prey to the
victim-hunting Palace spies. A year passed
without fresh alarms, and meanwhile no easy
opportunity of leaving the country presented
itself. I was just beginning to feel satisfied
that my caution was rendering any such disagreeable
change in my career unnecessary
when one night I was alarmed to discover that
a spy was actually at work plotting my ruin.
This happened in a Turkish bath. Before re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>lating
how this occurred, I will describe our
baths. The Turkish baths are much favoured
in England, and perhaps there may be some
among the readers of this book who may
like to know something about the baths in
Turkey. "Is the Turkish bath known in
Turkey?" This curious question is not infrequently
put to travellers from the East by
English people. It is true that there is
not much resemblance between the external
appearance and management of the so-called
Turkish bath in England and those of the
hammam in Turkey. Outwardly the hammam
usually presents something of the appearance
of a domed sepulchral edifice. Of the little
domes or cupolas which rise from its roof, that
in the middle is the highest, and is set with
many small windows for the purpose of lighting
the bath. The massive walls that form the
sides of the hammam have no windows, as it is
thought that if the walls were pierced the outside
air would penetrate into the interior and
cause variations in the evenness of temperature
which it is held desirable to maintain. The
interior thus often becomes very dose, as
ventilation is very slow, being only through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>opening by passers to and fro of the double
doors of the passage which leads to the cool
entrance-hall. Every now and then attendants
burn frankincense in the interior of the bath
with the idea of purifying the air. The great
warm hall under the central dome has generally
three large niches, two on each side and one in
front, as well as two little chambers. Each of
these niches and chambers has a roof in the
shape of a half-hemisphere, which contains a few
tiny glass apertures, and which is joined to the
central dome roof. In all these niches and
chambers there are, according to the size of the
bath, one, two, or three marble basins, which are
fixed to the low part of the wall, each basin
being provided with hot and cold water taps.
Round these basins people sit on marble or
wooden seats, which are raised about five or six
inches above the floor, and seated thereon they
have their bath. The little chambers can be
engaged for private use on application. One of
these is excessively hot, being situated close to
the hot-water reservoir. Some people go to this
hottest chamber not only in order to perspire,
more freely, but also for the purpose of washing
themselves with the warmest water in the bath.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>In the hot hall just under the central roof there
is a wide circular marble seat, raised about two
feet above the floor. Every bather sits or lies
on this seat before going up to one of the basins
to have his bath, and he stays there till he has
sufficiently perspired. While he is resting there
an attendant comes forward and rubs him with
a rough glove which is made of horse-hair;
and also massages him, if this is required.
After this operation the bather goes up to one
of the fixed basins, and the attendant follows
him with a large copper hand-basin and a big
piece of Cretan soap. The attendant then
turns on the hot and cold water taps, letting as
much water as may be required run from both
into the marble basin; he next proceeds to wash
the customer by soaping him with his loofah,
and then pouring water over him with the
copper hand-basin. Most Mohammedans, after
thus having a bath, make their ablution with
the flowing water, as is prescribed by their
religious law. When this is over the attendant
claps his hands loudly enough to be heard in
the entrance-hall, another bath-servant then
enters and rubs the customer with one of the
dry <i>Brossa</i> towels which he brings with him;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>then covering him up with others, he leads him
out, holding him by the arm. In the bath
everyone walks on high wooden pattens, as
after having made the ablution one must not
touch the floor over which the used water runs;
moreover, it is somewhat dangerous to walk
barefoot on the marble slabs with which the
bath is paved, as they are very slippery.
Between the warm hall and entrance-hall there
is a large square room, round which are arranged
several beds. The people sometimes dress
and undress in this room, especially in winter,
as, besides being free from draughts, this
apartment is warmer in temperature than the
entrance-hall. The latter is cool, and the air is
not so close and stuffy as in the middle room.</p>

<p>The entrance-hall is also square, and has
galleries running along on each side, in which
are many beds. The bath-keeper is always to
be seen in his place close to the door, smoking
his pipe or <i>narguileh</i>, and saluting the customers
who come and go. In the middle of the
entrance-hall is a fountain, the pure and cold
water of which is ceaselessly splashing into its
marble tank. In this water fresh fruits and
bottles of lemon squash are kept cool in summer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>time for the use of customers. Near it a man
may be seen always busy making coffee on the
charcoal fire; for most people are ready to
take a tiny cup of coffee at almost any time
during the day. There are some persons who
stay in the bath for a very long time, and at
the meal hours attendants may frequently be
observed bringing trays covered with dishes
from neighbouring restaurants.</p>

<p>The stove-room, where a huge fire is kept up
day and night all the year round, is situated at
the back of the bath building. It is underground,
and a large portion of its floor is
covered with piles of logs, the fuel used for heating
the water of the bath. The furnace itself
is very much like an oven upon which is placed
a huge boiler. This boiler receives cold water
from one side, and after heating it gives it to
the reservoir. Many homeless young vagrants
go to this underground place at night in winter
and sleep on the heaps of dried horse droppings
which are used as fuel along with the wood,
and which are piled up opposite the fireplace.
It is a dismal sight to see those poor young
fellows lying in that foul and filthy place. They
are allowed to shelter there by the fireman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>because he employs them in the hardest part
of his work without giving them any money.</p>

<p>Many of the Turkish baths are built double,
one part being assigned for the use of ladies.
In some places ladies go to the bath only on
certain days of the week which are given up
to them. Certain baths again are used by them
every day up till seven o'clock in the evening,
after which hour they are made over for the
use of men. The charges are very reasonable.
A man can have a complete bath, and may stay
on the premises of the establishment as long as
he pleases, by paying a sum of about is. 8d.,
and when going out, after paying this, he will
be respectfully greeted by the bath-keeper and
the attendants. Ladies pay much less than
this sum; their expenses can hardly be much
over sixpence, as they take all their own soaps,
towels and clogs with them. What they pay is
really the 'water fee' and a penny or two for
the attendants.</p>

<p>Women go to the bath oftener than men,
and they go in groups of three or four or more,
always taking their children with them. Boys
over eight or nine years of age are not allowed
to go to the women's bath, and even tall boys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>under that age are sometimes pushed back from
the door by the manageress, who is always a
stern and unbending personage. She usually
says to such tall boys, "Good heavens! Is
your father coming too?" and she will listen to
no expostulations from the boy's mother as to
his real age. The women's bath is always
crowded, and free fights for the fixed basins are
of not unfrequent occurrence. Shrill voices,
mingled with the howlings and cryings of
children anxious to be taken out of the almost
suffocating hot room, may sometimes be heard
from outside. This has given rise to a well-known
saying in Turkey which is used to
describe a noisy gathering where many persons
try to speak at the same time: "the place was
turned into a women's bath." When women
go to the bath they stay there all day long, and
on such occasions the poor husbands do not get
much to eat in the evening.</p>

<p>Men go to these establishments in order to
have a complete bath at least once a fortnight;
but they visit them oftener, especially in winter,
for the purpose of performing the ablutionary
washing ordained by the Mohammedan religion.
It is said that once an Armenian was annoyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>at seeing his Mussulman neighbours, besides
washing their arms, faces and feet five times a
day before the five canonical prayers, go to the
bath so often. He thought this a fanatical
religious fidgetiness. But when he went to
Egypt and saw the dirty fellaheen and Arabs,
he was obliged to confess that the Prophet
was quite right to establish his strict ablution
system.</p>

<p>The public baths in Turkey are mostly very
old buildings, for, as in most towns, the Turkish
population has not increased for many generations,
only very few new baths have been
erected. But in all the new houses of the well-to-do
families there are miniature Turkish baths
of two or three rooms. Still, notwithstanding
their stuffy atmosphere, and the horrid-looking
little vermin called 'bath locusts' that infest
them, even rich people prefer to go to the large
public baths. The baths in private houses are
only occasionally heated, and so the temperature
cannot be kept steady. They usually either
get very hot throughout, or else some parts
become so extremely hot that it is almost impossible
to touch the wall or the floor, while in
other places the marble is quite cold. Persons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>who wash themselves in these private baths in
winter not unfrequently run the risk of taking
a chill. A new feature which has been introduced
into the old Turkish bath is the cold
water douche, which it is becoming customary
for the people to take after their hot bath.
Whether the Turkish bath was originally
modelled on the system used by Romans, or
whether some of the bath-houses in Turkey
were founded by the Byzantines, it is quite
certain that all the good baths in large Turkish
towns were constructed and organised by the
Ottomans centuries ago; and although most
of them are now owned by private persons, a
certain portion of their revenue was originally
assigned to mosques, schools, and other religious
or charitable institutions. In Constantinople
there are about seventy-five public baths.</p>

<p>I remarked that the first intimation of danger
from the Palace espionage came to me in a bath.
One night I happened to be in a public bath in
Pera with a few friends. I must explain that
some of the Turkish baths are opened at night,
and so young men who work during the daytime
make up parties to go to them then.
There they eat, drink, and amuse themselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>and after the bath rest on the couches which
are always ready in the cooler section of the
bath-house. I was feeling particularly cheerful
that evening; there were a few other men in the
baths besides our party, and a short and feeble-looking
man, who was sitting close to me on the
raised marble in the centre of the hot chamber,
entered into conversation with me. As it is
usual in Turkish baths to take a lemon squash,
he offered me one. He was very amusing, and
talked of trivial matters at first; but presently
his conversation turned upon other subjects,
which were decidedly out of place. Not being
able to draw from me easily any remarks on
internal politics, he himself began to comment
on the state of affairs in our country in a way
which was unusually frank for a Turkish subject
in the present reign. Of course, like most of
my young countrymen, I was on the lookout
for possible peril from spies, so I professed
ignorance, and feigned to have little interest
in the political situation which he wanted
me to discuss. In spite of my reticence the
man became annoyingly persistent, and said
that I must be well-informed, because I was
acquainted with several Europeans. This last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>remark disturbed me not a little. The man
knew something about me. Although the
aggressive attitude of the fellow was provoking,
and although I was physically more than a
match for him, I refrained from ejecting him
from the baths, or thrashing him with a
wooden bath patten. To chastise the Palace
spies, as they deserve, is a very risky proceeding,
for they are the most trusted servants of his
Imperial Majesty. If I had given way to my
then still excitable temper, and had thrashed
my aggressor, I should certainly have been
sent into exile on the usual 'political charges,'
and the man himself would have been rewarded
by his imperial master. I pretended to be very
sleepy, and yawned constantly, thus eventually
persuading him to give it up and leave me
alone. As a matter of fact I was not sleepy,
and I did not sleep that night at all. I did not
tell my companions in the baths anything about
my experience. Next morning, when I left the
baths, my first business was to see my English
friend. Seeing that I was in rather a nervous
state of mind, he asked me what was the matter.</p>

<p>I requested him to help me to get out of 'this
cursed country.' The old gentleman said, in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>calm and compassionate manner, that I was a
traitor to call my own country 'cursed.' He
knew well that I was not a traitor, and that I
belonged to a family whose sons had shed
much blood in the defence of Turkey in the
past. I was not the only man who would be
happy to get away from his country. Not only
the thousands of Young-Turks who are in
exile and in prisons, but also many thousands
who are actually in the service of the Government,
would only be too glad to escape abroad
if they could get a chance. There is not one
of them who is for a moment safe from the spies,
and their flimsy but deadly accusations. These
people are not traitors, or even revolutionists,
but law-abiding, educated, and patriotic men,
who do not even wish for radical changes in the
established laws of their country, which work
satisfactorily if they are administered justly and
honestly. But they suffer from the most
capricious and cruel despotism of a single man,
who has made their country an absolute hell
for them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br /><br />

<small>FLIGHT TO ENGLAND.</small><br /><br /></h2>

<blockquote>

<p>I obtain a passage on a merchant vessel&mdash;A fortune of forty
pounds&mdash;The people on board the ship&mdash;The difficulty
of conversation&mdash;English cooking&mdash;Coffee and pig!
Gibraltar, a first impression of British soldiers&mdash;From
Hull to London&mdash;An instance of feminine courtesy&mdash;Lost
in the Underground&mdash;Olympia&mdash;An interview
with the Turkish Ambassador&mdash;A promise of justice
conditional on my return to Turkey.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I described my last night's experience,
my English friend promised to see about getting
me out of the country, and to let me know soon
what he could do in the matter. A few days
after this he sent word telling me to come and
see him. I went, and he informed me that
another English resident, who had something
to do with the British steamers which pass
through the Bosphorus, carrying cargoes
between the Black Sea ports and England,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>would arrange with a captain to take me on
board his ship, and after some days it was
actually done. I must not give here the name
of the latter gentleman, who is still in Constantinople,
because he asked me not to tell anyone.</p>

<p>Forty pounds of ready money was all I
possessed in the world. It was no longer
possible for me to get any more money from
my confiscated lands, and moreover, whatever
the excuse, I felt ashamed to ask for any
further help from my mother, now that I was
of an age at which I ought to have been able to
help her, and increase the comfort of her life.
I think my venture in coming to the great
capital of the British empire with forty pounds
in my pocket was more risky than that of those
who come to it with the proverbial half-crown,
because they are at least either British-born or
English-speaking people, whereas I was coming
from an Eastern country, without knowing anyone
in England, and without speaking English.
However, I did not think much about what
might happen to me. I eagerly hastened my
departure from the capital of my country to
England. I knew that there, whatever else
might befall, the personal freedom of a law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>-abiding
individual was secure. My idea was to
remain in England until a more tolerable state
of things should be established in Turkey, when
I would return to Constantinople; or, in case of
not being able to remain in England, I would
learn some English, and go to some British
possession in the East where I should find
myself more at home.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of April 22, 1894,
that I was informed that an English steamer
had just arrived from a Russian port on the
Black Sea, and that she was going to leave
the harbour of Constantinople the same afternoon.
The English gentleman kindly spoke to
the captain of the ship about me, and obtained
his promise to take me on board if I paid
him five pounds for the whole journey, everything
included. Of course, I had been waiting
for some days for the arrival of an English
boat in which I could take my flight I had
placed all the clothes and documents which I
wanted to take with me in a portmanteau. As
an additional kindness, the Englishman offered
to bring my portmanteau to the ship, as in this
case it would be free from examination by the
customs and police officers in the port After
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>sending my bag to him, I crossed over the
Asiatic coast of the Constantinople harbour,
where I engaged a boatman to take me across
to the English ship. I had previously had her
pointed out to me at her moorings. My object
in going over to the Asiatic coast and then
crossing back to the steamer was to avoid the
suspicion and pursuit of the secret police, as I
had no passport, and in fact could not have
procured one. Indeed, very few Ottoman
subjects are given passports for going abroad,
and then only under special circumstances, and
with the permission of the Palace. Happily,
at that time the cargo ships bound for European
ports were not much watched, though all
passenger boats were rigidly inspected by the
police before starting. So I got on board
without any difficulty, though with much
anxiety, and found that the Englishman was
already there. He gave me my portmanteau,
introduced me to the captain, and after bidding
me good-bye went on shore. It was not long
before the steamer started.</p>

<p>The steamer, on which I was the only
passenger, was laden with wheat, and her
destination was Hull. The captain, a middle-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>aged
man of somewhat stern appearance, had
with him on board his wife and her sister, and
they were all very kind to me. We were very
cheerful, and the steward, who was an Irishman,
was full of fun, and particularly fond of addressing
me with what I imagined to be humorous
remarks, and thus making me and the others
laugh, though, unfortunately, I did not understand
a word he said My English was as yet
confined to a very limited number of words,
and whenever they wanted to tell me something
they wrote it down on a slip of paper, and
with great labour I managed to translate their
snatches of conversation by looking out every
word in my pocket dictionary. Although there
was no possibility of my learning any European
language in my school days in Asia Minor, I
had nevertheless picked up some French by
reading a French grammar in Turkish while
residing in Pera, and I thought that my French,
little as it was, would be of some help to
me in talking to the people of the ship, but
not a single person on board seemed to know
any French. My chief amusement on board
was playing with the two baby daughters of
the captain, who were typical specimens of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>the clean, healthy, and lovable children one so
often sees in England. I spent hours every
day with these two pretty babies, and my
voluntary assistance must have been a great
relief to their good-looking fair-haired nurse,
who, while I was playing with the children,
either read a book or amused herself by chatting
and laughing with the officers of the ship.
I could not understand their conversation, of
course, but it was obvious that the men found
the task of amusing her pleasant enough. The
captain, who appeared to be part-owner of the
boat, was a man who appreciated good living,
and he supplied us with satisfactory food. The
English cooking, which I tasted for the first
time on this boat, seemed to me quite different
from the European dishes to be obtained in
the new restaurants and brasseries in Constantinople.
It was also quite unlike Turkish
cooking, which, though I lived in foreign
countries and become accustomed to their
food, I still maintain is excellent. Although I
had no reason to be fastidious, and grumble
about the food on board, which was decidedly
superior to that which families of limited
means and residents in boarding-houses get in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>England, there were two things I did not like.
One of these was the English coffee, which was
given to us both with breakfast and with the last
meal, served out about six in the afternoon. I
missed very much the coffee of my country.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span></p>

<p>The other was pork. The very sight of the
fatty meat on the table was quite enough to
destroy my appetite. It was not so much on
account of the rules of the faith which I profess
that I was horrified to see the flesh of the
pig before me; drinking wine is as strictly
forbidden to us as eating pork, but I had
already transgressed the good rules of total
abstinence. My invincible objection to pork is
based upon my early impressions, when I was
taught to look upon the pig as the dirtiest
animal in creation, and I cannot even now get
over that feeling of dislike, though I have been
living among pig-eating Europeans for several
years.</p>

<p>On the eleventh day after our departure from
the Bosphorus we arrived at Gibraltar, where
the ship stopped for a few hours, and taking
advantage of this, I hailed a Spanish boatman
and was rowed to the town. In the town I
discovered a Moorish shop, in which an elderly
white-turbaned Arab was sitting. Owing to my
ignorance of English I had not been able to
talk with anyone since our departure, and
I was longing to find someone with whom
I could have a chat, so I greeted him with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>salaam and talked to him. At first he appeared
rather reluctant to enter into conversation with
me. I think he suspected me of being a fraud,
posing as the follower of the same Prophet in
order to cheat or swindle him. However, we
parted on friendly terms. He entertained a
poor opinion of the Spaniards, but liked the
English. In this town I saw British soldiers
for the first time. They were on parade. I
admired the neatness and newness of their
uniform, which was decidedly much superior to
that of our troops; but, on the other hand, I
thought the bearing of the Turkish soldiery
was more naturally military than that of the
Englishmen. But I was much struck by the
appearance of some hardy, weather-beaten, and
determined&mdash;looking blue jackets who were
walking about. It may be that what I had
already heard of the men who had helped to
build up Great Britain's sea-power made me
admire these brave sailors the more. After
seeing one or two more of the sights of Gibraltar,
I hurried back to our ship, which started about
an hour later for England. How dreadfully
slowly cargo boats move! It took seven days
to go from Gibraltar to Hull.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span></p>
<p>On May 8th our boat reached Hull at dusk,
but she could not enter the docks before the
next morning. Next day, early in the morning,
I landed, and the captain's sister-in-law kindly
accompanied me, took me to the station, and
put me into a train for London. On the
journey I was delighted and wonderstruck
with the beauty of the scenery, the high state
of cultivation visible, the canals and the
railways, with what seemed to me a prodigious
number of trains constantly passing to and fro,
the activity apparent at the crowded stations,
and many signs of prosperity everywhere, all
of which were then strange to me. Already I
could perceive how great a difference existed
between little England and large but poverty-stricken
Asia Minor. If an Englishman of
the eighteenth century could rise out of his
grave and see what I saw on that day, his
bewilderment at the advancement of his
country would not, I think, be greater than
was mine. At every large station I anxiously
tried to find out whether we were in London.
At one place, putting some of the few English
words I knew together, I made up an interrogatory
sentence, and addressed it to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>middle-aged well-dressed lady who was sitting
opposite me in the carriage. I wanted to ask
her whether we were far from London. The
lady could not understand my meaning, and
turning her face towards the other people in
the carriage she said, with a thoroughly
unsympathetic air, "Foreigner!" I remember
this word so well. I was sadly impressed by
this lady's rudeness. She was quite right in
saying I was a foreigner, but I was not one of
those foreigners who are so narrow-minded as
to think evilly of a whole nation because they
have been treated rudely or without sympathy
by one or more of its members. Happily she
could not know I was a Turk, as, like most of
her class, she would probably have taken for
Turks those short, dark, shabby persons, with
turban or fez, who occasionally come to this
country from different corners of the vast
Orient. If she had known I was a real Turk,
a member of the much maligned nation, against
which her Christian heart must needs have
been full of mediæval prejudices, I fancy her
rudeness towards me would probably have
been still more marked.</p>

<p>At a huge station the train again stopped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>and everyone in the carriage got out I said
to myself doubtfully that this must be London.
A porter came to the door, looked round the
carriage, and then stared at me. I said to him
"Laundaun?" He said, "Yes, London." So
I got out and he took my bag. Whither was I
going now? I was going to a place of which the
name was written in my pocket-book, no less a
place than Olympia. It was the year that some
enterprising Israelite gentlemen had undertaken
to represent Constantinople in London,
and they sent an agent to Constantinople to
bring over some Turks as boatmen, and to
perform other services in their show. The
agent whom I met at the Turkish capital did
not, however, succeed in bringing a single Turk,
as the police, by order of the Sultan, would
not allow any such men to leave Turkey.
The agent therefore engaged some Greeks as
boatmen, and some Jews came to set up stalls
of embroidery and other things at Olympia.
I hoped that some of these people would help
me in finding a lodging. I said to the porter
at King's Cross station "Olympia?" and he
nodded and said "Yes, Kensington," and signed
to me to follow him through a subterranean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>passage down to the Underground, and put me
into a train which I believe was not going
direct to Olympia I lost my way in the
Underground, got out at many stations, changed
often into many trains, and paid several fares.
It was nearly dark by now, and the trains
were all full. I mixed up Kensington, of
which the porter had told me, with the somewhat
similar name of Kennington. I found
it very trying to rush in and out at every
station with my heavy bag in my hand. Many
people laughed at my stupid excitement, but
some, better bred than the others, attempted
to assist me, though their efforts were not
of much use to a person who was practically
speechless. At one station my French
vocabulary came to my assistance, so I
succeeded in hiring a boy to come with me,
and at last I got to Addison Road station.
Outside Olympia I saw a man with a red fez
on his head, and wearing some sort of odd
Oriental dress which I had never seen in
Turkey. I spoke to this man in Turkish, and
from his accent discovered that he was a
Turkish Jew. Through this fellow I engaged
a room in a neighbouring lodging-house.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span></p>
<p>On the day following my arrival in London
I addressed a letter to the Sultan, explaining
to him how I and my people had been ruined
by our many years' lawsuit in his courts, agitating
for the restoration of our property, and
requesting him to issue an <i>iradé</i> granting us,
if not all the rights we had lost, at least the
income from our lands which had accumulated
during our lawsuit, and was being misapplied
by some of his officials. I based my appeal on
the imperial firmans and legal documents of
the case, and stuck to my point firmly. I
learned the result of this petition a fortnight
later, when I was invited to the Ottoman
Embassy. The late Rustem Pasha, who was
then Ambassador, received me with a cheerful
courtesy which was, I thought, more than
a private individual like myself could deserve.
This was at a time when the Sultan was
extremely anxious lest his discontented subjects
should form revolutionary committees in
Europe to stir up an agitation for general
reforms in his dominions. He was particularly
suspicious of those of his subjects who came to
the free capital of Great Britain, as relations
between this country and the Sultan were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>then anything but friendly. The Ambassador
asked my object in coming to England, and I
told him that I had merely desired to learn
English and gain experience abroad which
might be of use to me later in my own country.
I said that all I wanted was the payment of
my own money, so that I might devote myself
to study. The old Ambassador said that most
careful consideration would be given to my
case, and that I should be given a suitable
Government post if I would return to Constantinople
at the Sultan's expense. I declined
the offer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br /><br />

<small>A RETURN AND A SECOND FLIGHT.</small><br /><br /></h2>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> twenty days passed, and then I was
again asked to go to the Embassy. Rustem
Pasha told me that it was the desire of his
Majesty that I should return and give a
practical proof that I was not implicated in
any plot against the person of the Sultan,
and that in that case I should certainly be
highly rewarded. He, moreover, assured me
that I should be allowed to come to Europe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>again whenever I wished to do so. This
offer was in reality an appeal to my vanity,
for, humble individual though I was, I was
now led to suppose seriously that I was
becoming a more important person than I
had suspected. The aged diplomatist was
very emphatic in impressing me with the
necessity of accepting the invitation. I asked
him what guarantee I could have that I should
be allowed to remain unmolested on entering
Turkey, and to return to Europe when I
wanted to do so. He gave me a distinct
promise that my requests would be granted.
The Pasha was one of the Ottomanised Europeans,
was Catholic by religion, and was
known to be a gentleman; if he had been a
native Christian of the Levant I should most
decidedly not have put faith in his words.</p>

<p>In this connection I should like to remark
that for a good many years past the Ottoman
Ambassadors to the British Court have been
appointed from among the Christian subjects of
Turkey. It is reported by the <i>entourage</i> of the
Sultan that the reason for this was the objection
of the British Government to the appointment
of Mussulman Ambassadors. This report must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>have been purposely spread with a view to
represent Englishmen to Moslems as hostile to
Islam. The real reason must, I think, be, that
as there are some bigoted politicians and
publicists in this country who always cry out
for the appointment of Christian officials at the
head of all affairs in the Ottoman empire, the
Sultan wishes to show them that he employs
Christians even in important diplomatic posts.
As a matter of fact, in days gone by there have
been Mussulman Ambassadors accredited to the
Court of St James's.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>
<p>After my second interview with Rustem Pasha
another fortnight elapsed, during which I considered
anxiously what might happen to me if
I returned; and what I should do if I remained
in London. Meanwhile I was feeling very
unwell, my money was rapidly decreasing, and
there was not the slightest prospect of my finding
suitable employment, and no possibility of
my communicating with my people at home to
ask for help, so I decided to return; I thought I
now had a chance. As the Sultan knew me,
I could get my money from the Government
and come back to England. But I was
sadly mistaken in my conjectures. It would
have been impossible for any man who was
not endowed by nature with that particular
cunning so necessary for getting on in life to
play such a rôle. I discovered my error to my
sorrow when I arrived at Constantinople. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>past master of the art of deception such as
Abd-ul-Hamid was not easily to be outwitted.
When I went to the Embassy for the third
time I said I would return, so the officials telegraphed
to Constantinople, and in three days a
money order came. The sum was about seventy-five
pounds, and I was urged to start at once by
the <i>Orient Express</i>.</p>

<p>About the beginning of August 1894 I left
England, stopping for two weeks on my journey
in Paris, and a few days in Buda-Pesth, the
capital of the people between whom and the
Turks there is a community of origin, and whom
we fought and subjugated for generations. On
arriving at Constantinople the police officials
sternly asked my name, whence I came, and
where I was going to put up. I told them I
was going direct to the imperial palace, whereupon
they saluted me and I got out of the
station with some feeling of relief. It was a
foolhardy game I was attempting to play. I
was now at the mercy of an autocrat who
deals with his Osmanli subjects in his own
well known fashion, and I was one of the few
who was enlightened enough to see his true
characteristics, and in consequence to detest his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>rule at heart In the Yildiz Palace I was really
shivering with anxiety, knowing that here
thousands of people who were denounced as
'Young-Turks' were imprisoned, examined,
and tortured, and then sent into exile. While
awaiting my fate in the palace, a certain Faik
Bey, one of the Sultan's trusted courtiers, a man
of no good repute, came to me with a very kind
message from his Majesty. He was glad that
I had obeyed him, and come back from the
country which "is nursing hostility to Turkey,
and plotting against the cause of the Caliphate."
I am not certain whether these were the words
of the Sultan, or whether his courtier made
them up. The Sultan sent me twenty pounds
as pocket-money and wished me to go home and
rest. Well, this apparently kind treatment was
consoling, but, however foolhardy, I had sense
enough to see that it was not a good omen for
the future. Just as I was leaving the palace I
was ordered by the courtier not to mix with
people much, and to live as quietly as possible.
He also asked me to come and see him after
two days. From the palace I went to Pera
and engaged apartments. I was now afraid of
going to see my relations and friends. I met
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>some of them later on while going about in
Constantinople, and we had to pass each other
with a mere salute, as they were also afraid
of being reported by the spies for talking to
me, since they knew all about my escaping to
England It is a very depressing and lonely
condition to be in, to have to avoid one's friends
and relations because a tyrant has issued a
warning to that effect.</p>

<p>In compliance with the order, I went to the
Palace again and saw the same chamberlain.
He handed me over another twenty pounds as
a mark of imperial benevolence, and said he
would pay me the same amount every month
as 'private salary.' And then he said in a low
voice, coming nearer to me, "His Majesty, our
benevolent master, commands me to ask you to
write a report if you hear anything important on
the political situation." My heart froze on hearing
this contemptible proposal. By a monthly
salary of twenty pounds the Sultan wanted to
make me a Palace spy! A downright refusal
would bring ruin on me, so I told the courtier
that as I had been ordered not to come into
intimate contact with other people, I could not
hear anything of importance. He said there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>would be no harm in my meeting Europeans.
I did not understand the significance of this
last remark at the moment Proceeding in his
talk, the courtier said that as I had graduated
in law, the Minister of Justice would be ordered
to make me a deputy prosecutor-general in the
central criminal courts of Constantinople. I
carefully avoided alluding to the promise of the
Sultan made to me by his representative in
London, that the income of my property would
be given to me, and that I should be allowed
to go to Europe. Nor did I express any desire
to go to Europe again. I was made a deputy
prosecutor-general in a few days by a special
<i>iradé</i>. Before I went to England they would
never have given me a post even inferior to this
had I applied for it again and again for months.
There are about a dozen deputy or assistant
prosecutors like myself in these central courts,
and each of them gets a salary of nearly £180
a year. As a rule, they are not very busy
people. As my superiors could not urge me to
attend the office, imagining I was highly in
favour at the Sultan's palace, I did not care
much about going to the court, and making one
of the idle scamps there. I was hard at work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>devising a new plan of escaping once more
from the hands of the Sultan.</p>

<p>At this time, when his Majesty appeared to
be going to honour me so magnanimously with
a Government appointment, as well as with that
attractive 'private salary' in order to tempt me
to acts of espionage, his spies kept an eye on
my movements constantly. Every day I was
watched, talked to, and even entertained by
two or three of these creatures. I informed my
old English friend of all that had happened to
me of late. He reproached me for being so
imprudent as to return to Turkey, and not going
to Egypt if I had to leave England. However,
what was done was done, and it was no good
regretting it What I wanted now was to
escape out of the country again as soon as I
could get an opportunity. My friend seemed
very sceptical as to my chances of success in
running away a second time, as he thought, and
rightly too, that the watch on my movements
would be far stricter now than it was before.</p>

<p>While things were in this condition, I was
one morning hurriedly summoned to the palace
by a mounted messenger. Of course I had to
go at once and saw the same courtier who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>so suavely informed me of the imperial benevolence
on the two former occasions. This
time his manner seemed grave and cool, and so
soon as I was seated he said that he was
surprised that I should abuse the generous
kindness of our august benefactor. On my
anxiously asking him the nature of my fault, he
said he had received a report (an espionage
report, of course) that I was revealing confidential
matters of State among the Europeans
of Pera. He showed me the report, carefully
hiding, however, the signature beneath it with
his thumb. I at once discovered the author of
the shameless document from the handwriting.
The man, who never perhaps supposed that the
report would have been shown to me, had
hospitably invited me to dinner two days
previously. The courtier gave me a sharp
warning to avoid spreading the confidential
matters of the Sultan's Government among
foreigners. Although my safety seemed to be
hanging on a thread at that time, I nevertheless
collected my faculties and ventured on a bold
stroke. I said that as he was the only court
official I had had the honour of seeing, I asked
him whether he would be good enough to tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>me what were those secret matters which he
had confided to me, and which I was accused
of spreading among the Europeans. He
appeared somewhat embarrassed by this, and
his evident perplexity was a relief to me. We
parted in a friendly manner, and as I was
leaving he said, "Remember your private
salary will be due in ten days." This was the
monthly twenty pounds which he was going
to pay me privately if I stained my honour by
doing the dirty work of espionage.</p>

<p>On returning home in a great state of worry I
had a tiny cup of Turkish coffee, which I used
to find a great relief in times of trouble, and
counted my fortune, which amounted to less
than fifty pounds. This was, however, amply
sufficient to carry me to England. The first
difficulty before me was to find another English
captain to take me, and then to succeed in
getting on board his ship. All the boatmen
in the harbour had been threatened with punishment
if they carried suspicious persons to
any foreign ships other than those passenger
boats which are watched by the police. As a
prelude to my plan of escaping, I thought it
would be wise to take a boat and go for a row
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>on the sea every day. I told everyone I met,
including those Palace detectives who were
always at my heels, that I had been advised by
my doctor to get as much sea air as possible,
and therefore was going for a row every day.
On the next day after deciding to begin boating
I went down to one of the many landing-places
of the Golden Horn, where several boatmen
are always in waiting to pick up passengers. I
hailed one of these boatmen, and told him to
take me for a row up the Bosphorus. After
some time the boatman wanted to know where
I wished to go. I told him curtly to go straight
ahead, and he did so. When he stopped to
light a cigarette I asked him how much he
earned in a day, and he said that his profits
fluctuated between seven and ten piastres. If
a Turkish boatman gains ten piastres (about
1s. 8d.) a day he may consider himself lucky. I
told him the same story of my medical prescription
of sea air, and offered him fifteen
piastres a day if he would take no other
customers, but place himself at my disposal
every day. As I expected, he readily agreed to
this arrangement. My boating trips lasted a
week. I went on the sea sometimes in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>morning and sometimes in the afternoon.
Sometimes I occupied myself with fishing, and
sometimes with reading in the boat; occasionally,
too, I approached and boarded the sailing crafts
in the harbour, and watched them lading and
unlading their cargoes. Besides his wages I
used to give the boatman tobacco, which pleased
him well. He did whatever I wanted him to do,
and went wherever I ordered. I do not know
if I was ever followed by the spies on the sea;
anyhow, nothing occurred to rouse my suspicions.</p>

<p>After thus arranging the first part of my
plan of flight, which was to find a boatman who
would, consciously or unconsciously, take me to
the prohibited foreign ships, I now came to the
arrangement of the more important part, namely,
finding a ship bound at once for England. By
myself I could not have done this, so I took the
liberty of again approaching that Englishman
who was interested in shipping traffic, and who
had helped me on my first voyage to this
country. The excellent fellow said a steamer
was due from Batoum on the Black Sea that
very day, but she was to start on the same
afternoon. I said I was quite ready to start;
but he could only send me away on two con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>ditions.
One was, that this time I must see
about conveying my luggage myself to the boat,
because the Government supervision over the
movements of English ships had become stricter,
and so he would not compromise himself. I
did not mind this at all But the second condition
he laid down was alarming. He said
that as the captain of this ship was not allowed
to take any passengers, I must go to the British
Consulate and sign my name in the captain's
book as a seaman. Of course there was no
harm in my doing this, as in reality I should
not be expected to do a sailor's work; but an
Ottoman subject, who has just become known
to the Palace authorities, is not well advised to
go to the British Consulate, for it is known to
be watched by the spies, and he is certain to be
seen. However, I ran the risk, went to the
Consulate, and put down my name as a seaman.
The captain directed me to the exact spot
where his boat was anchored, and told me that
in about three hours' time she was to start I
did not go to my rooms where I had left all my
belongings. The house in which I was living
belonged to some Germans, who afterwards,
without the slightest justification, refused to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>deliver up my property to the people who applied
on my behalf for it until I had paid a
considerable sum of money. Well, it is perhaps
the policy of the Teutonic invaders of Turkey
to rob the Turks as much as possible, as the
price of their friendship to the precious person
of the Sultan.</p>

<p>Immediately after getting out of the British
Consulate I called a cab, and ordered the cabman
to proceed to the palace of Yildiz as fast
as he could. My object in going to the Palace
in this critical moment was that I thought that
if my entrance to the Consulate had been seen,
the spies would imagine that I was in charge
of an official message, and moreover they would
not follow a man whose destination was the
Palace, and who might in all probability turn
out to be one of the Sultan's creatures like
themselves. I reached the Yildiz Kiosk, and
went up to the office of my friend the courtier.
He was out, and his absence at that moment
suited my purpose capitally, as the excuse which
I should have had to concoct for this uncalled
for visit would have been but weak. From
Yildiz I took another cab and went down to
the shore. My boatman was yawning, being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>tired of waiting inactive. I jumped into the
boat and told him the direction in which he
was to row, which was of course towards the
steamer, though he did not know that I had
determined to sail for England in it When
we got near the steamer I observed to my boatman
it seemed a peculiar vessel, having its
funnel rather far back, and not in the middle
of the deck as is usual. The boatman knew
that it was an oil boat and that its engine was
therefore constructed at the back. I pretended
to be curious to see the ship, and the simple-minded
boatman readily rowed to its side. I
got on board with great relief.</p>

<p>I was now practically on British territory.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
After seeing the captain I went to the side and
shouted down to the boatman that as I talked
the language of the people of the ship they had
asked me to stay a little while on board and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>have tea with them. I told him he need not
wait in the strong current of water, as I could
hail any passing boatman when I wanted to go
ashore, and I threw him down his day's wage.
He went away, and we started not long after.
I should not have played all these tricks if the
Sultan had kept his promise and treated me
honourably.</p>

<p>This second departure from Constantinople
took place on the 8th of November 1894, and
the oil ship reached Liverpool eighteen days
after, without stopping anywhere on the way.
As I had not been able to take any extra
clothes I suffered much from cold, and also from
the rough sea all the way. The men on board
the ship were rough sailors, and the captain himself
was an extremely stingy person. He supplied
us with abominably bad food. However,
I arrived in England safely, and ever since that
time have made this country my home, and
during my periodical trips abroad I have never
entered the territories of my own country, over
which the tyranny of Abd-ul-Hamid still prevails.</p>

</p>
<p>
"A propos of distempers, I am going to tell you a thing
that I am sure will make you wish yourself here. The
smallpox, so fatal and so general amongst us, is here
entirely harmless by the invention of ingrafting, which is
the term they give it. There is a set of old women who
make it their business to perform the operation every
autumn, in the month of September, when the great heat is
abated. People send to one another to know if any of their
family has a mind to have the smallpox; they make parties
for this purpose, and when they are met (commonly fifteen
or sixteen together) the old woman comes with a nutshell
full of the matter of the best sort of smallpox and asks
what veins you please to have opened. She immediately
rips open that you offer to her with a large needle (which gives
you no more pain than a common scratch), and puts into
the vein as much venom as can lie upon the head of her
needle, and after binds up the little wound with a hollow
bit of shell, and in this manner opens four or five veins.... The
children or young patients play together all
the rest of the day, and are in perfect health until the
eighth. Then the fever begins to seize them, and they
keep their beds two days, or seldom three. They have
rarely above twenty or thirty in their faces, which never
mark; and in right days' time they are as well as before
their illness.... There is no example of anyone that has
died in it; and you may well believe I am very well
satisfied of the safety of the experiment, since I intend to
try it on my little son.

the Armenian revolutionaries directed their attacks against

that they wanted to provoke bloodshed, and by this means
invite outside intervention. Moreover, it was manifestly to

aware of the good points of your people, yet you are so
unpopular in Christendom. In every international dispute
Europe always regards you as in the wrong. Do you understand
the reason of this universal hostility?" The
diplomatist replied, "Because we are not Christians."
"Exactly," said the Pontiff. "Then why do you not
embrace Christianity?" Upon this the diplomatist made
the following undiplomatic remark, "The Christians believe
in Trinity, and we believe in Unity. Some of us are growing
tired of worshipping even one God. How, then, could
you expect us to worship three?"</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">8</span></a> No European musical instrument is so much appreciated
by Orientals as the bagpipe; it takes a long time to make
the average Oriental understand and admire the masterpieces
of the great musicians of the West played on any
ordinary European instrument. But he takes to the bagpipes
on the first hearing, and it is seldom that he gets
tired of them. Of course there is much similarity both in
the sound and in the manner of playing between bagpipes
and a certain popular Oriental instrument which is played
mostly by Turks, Arabs, Kurds, and Armenians. Although
the tone and the style of playing this Oriental instrument
resemble those of the bagpipes so much, there is considerable
difference in the form and make. The bag of this
instrument, which is called 'tooloom,' is made from a sheep's
skin; besides the small mouthpiece there is only one large
reedpipe from which the notes are obtained, and which thus
replaces the chanter and the three drones of its Highland
counterpart. The player, placing the blown-up sheepskin
against his chest, and supporting it by the upper part of his
left arm, moves his fingers up and down over the holes in
the larger pipe. As a matter of fact, the sound of this
instrument, like much other Oriental music, appears to
European listeners dull and discordant, but it pleases the
uncultivated taste of the ordinary Orientals. At the popular
fêtes it is a very common thing to see many people, middle-aged
as well as young, dancing together in a circle, while
pipe and drum fill the air with ceaseless clamour. It is
difficult to trace the original home of this instrument. It
may be conjectured that it was brought from the West by the
persons who went to the East with the Crusaders, or it may
have been copied from them, with certain modifications in
form, by the Eastern peoples.</p></div>

enthusiastic in their praises of the Turkish coffee which they
drank out there. There is no reason why coffee prepared
in the Turkish style should not become popular here.
There is no difficulty about making it That the coffee may
have the delicious flavour it has in the Levant, the beans must
be freshly roasted and ground very fine. The water must
be boiled in a tin or copper coffee-pot To supply, say,
four or five persons with coffee in tiny cups, two or three
teaspoonfuls of the powder should be put into the pot while
the water is actually boiling therein. Some people do not
like sugar in their coffee, but if sugar is required it should
be put into the boiling water and allowed to melt before
the coffee is added. Great sweetness is not appreciated by
connoisseurs in coffee drinking. When the ground coffee is
added to the boiling water, the pot should be taken off the
fire and the coffee stirred up in the water with a teaspoon.
Then it should be put on the fire again until the froth rises
up. It is then poured into the cups. It is better to pour
out the coffee slowly, placing the pot on the fire at short
intervals, and thus getting more froth for pouring out into
the cups, as the taste of the coffee is supposed to be better
with the yellowish froth on the surface. It is on account
of this idea that greedy people in Turkey choose those cups
that have the most froth when coffee is handed round on
a tray, leaving those with less to the others who are waiting
their turn to be served.</p></div>

Effendi, a Mussulman, who came over to this country in
1793. The following paragraph is translated from his
memoirs:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"We proceeded to the village of Chelsea, which is about
an hour's distance from London. The King's Master of
Ceremony came and felicitated us on our arrival, and conveyed
the compliments of the King. The ceremony of our
reception having been fixed for the following day, I sent on
the presents. Next day the state carriages came. I entered
one that was drawn by four horses; with me were a nobleman
and the Master of the Ceremony. My suite were in
the other carriages along with some court officials.
</p>
<p>
"When we were passing along the road called Piccadilly
there were collected to see us so many people that never in
my life had I seen so great a crowd; indeed I afterwards
heard that several persons had been injured through the
pressing of the crowd trying to get a glimpse of us. Our
dress and our turbans must, I think, have appeared very
curious to them. We arrived at St James's Palace, and after
I had presented my credentials we were invited to dinner.
What most impressed me was the charming manners and
appearance of the ladies. Some young ladies belonging to
the King's family bound round their heads the embroidered
silk handkerchiefs I had offered on behalf of my sovereign,
and said laughingly and with infinite grace, 'Now we belong
to the harem of his Majesty the Sultan!'"</p></div>

not, in international law, be exactly considered parts of the
territory of the State to which they belong when they are in
foreign ports. But owing to the privileged state of foreign
ships in the Ottoman empire, the Sultan could not now,
under any circumstances, have taken me back from this
paraffin-oil ship, had he been informed of my taking refuge
there.</p></div>
